Mantis open source is hosted on Github. Issues are also tracked on Github
and we prefer to receive contributions as pull requests.

### Contributing

Mantis components are spread across a few different repos. See the
[Components](https://github.com/netflix/mantis#mantis-components) section in the README
for more information.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to follow the instructions
on the repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
