[MQL] Queries that implement [aggregates (`COUNT`, `SUM`, etc.)](../MQL/operators#aggregates), as
well as those that use windowing (like [`window`](../MQL/operators#window) or
[`group by`](../MQL/operators#group-by)), must necessarily maintain state.

[The Mantis Publish library)](../glossary#mantispublish) and the [Source Jobs] do not perform MQL
aggregation on the server side; consequently this must take place on the client side. This limits
the blast radius if a client runs a long window or runs an aggregate against a large amount of data.
However this creates potential scaling problems on the client side. This page will help you address
such problems.

## Details
There are two primary technical concerns in these cases:

1. Windowing must necessarily buffer the output until the end of the window.
1. `group by` cannot run multithreaded as [RxJava] does not guarantee pairs with the same key end up
   on the same thread.

In the first case, as a client you’re simply facing a memory issue as you must have enough memory to
buffer until the end of each window. However usually when you window, you are also performing some
form of aggregate against the window (otherwise there is little point in windowing rather than just
emitting the data immediately).

The second case requires a single thread in order to guarantee that aggregate calculations against
groups will be performed together.

A naive solution would be to always run MQL on a single thread. This solves the problem but is the
least-scalable solution and also impacts queries do not require such restrictive behavior.

## Solutions
There are a number of possible approaches you can take to address this problem. These primarily
involve a tradeoff between engineering effort and effectiveness.

### Solution A (Implemented)
The MQL library includes `isAggregate()`, which is a function of `String` ⇒ `Boolean` that indicates
whether or not a given query requires an aggregate operation. This allows you to test a query to
determine if if requires single-threading and handle it appropriately if so.

This represents a low-effort / medium-effectiveness tradeoff; only queries that require the
serialized behavior will suffer the performance penalty.

### Solution B (TBD?)
A more scalable solution would be to enable MQL to emit additional formats. An example of this would
be a Mantis topology backend that could emit multi-[stage] Mantis [Jobs] that implement the desired
operation in a scalable fashion. A group-by stage that distributes values to downstream workers
using consistent hashing would be able to scale horizontally based on the number of groups (still
vertically for window size).

This solution requires significantly more engineering effort, but represents a very large increase
in scalability for these queries. It would be a possibly-fruitful road for the Mantis open source
software project to travel.
