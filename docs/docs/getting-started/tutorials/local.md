# Explore a Mantis Job locally

## Prerequisites

JDK 8 or higher

## Build and run the synthetic-sourcejob sample

Clone the mantis-examples repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Netflix/mantis-examples.git
```

Run the synthetic-sourcejob sample via gradle.

This job outputs request events sourced from an imaginary service. The RequestEvent data
has information such as uri, status, userId, country etc.
Data Source Jobs are mantis jobs that allow consumers to filter the raw stream down to just the events 
they are interested in. 
This filtering is done by specifying an [MQL query](../../develop/querying/mql.md) while connecting to the sink.

To run the sample execute the following command.
```bash
$ cd mantis-examples/synthetic-sourcejob
$ ../gradlew execute
```
This will launch the job and you would see output like
```bash

2019-10-06 14:14:07 INFO  StageExecutors:254 main - initializing io.mantisrx.sourcejob.synthetic.stage.TaggingStage
2019-10-06 14:14:07 INFO  SinkPublisher:82 main - Got sink subscription, onSubscribe=null
2019-10-06 14:14:07 INFO  ServerSentEventsSink:141 main - Serving modern HTTP SSE server sink on port: 8436
```

The default Mantis sink is a ServerSentEvent sink that opens a port allowing anyone to connect
to it and stream the results of the job.
Look for a line like
```bash
Serving modern HTTP SSE server sink on port: 8436
```
The source job is now up and ready to serve data.

Let us query for requests from countries where the status code is 500. 
Such an MQL query would like like this. 
```bash
select country from stream where status==500
```
In another terminal window curl this port
```bash
$ curl "localhost:8436?subscriptionId=nj&criterion=select%20country%20from%20stream%20where%20status%3D%3D500&clientId=nj2"
```
Here the subscriptionId and clientId are any valid strings. They are used to tag events that match the query.
The criterion parameter is the URLEncoded MQL query.

You should see events matching your query appear in your terminal

```bash
data: {"country":"Ecuador","mantis.meta.sourceName":"SyntheticRequestSource","mantis.meta.timestamp":1570396602599,"status":500}

data: {"country":"Solomon Islands","mantis.meta.sourceName":"SyntheticRequestSource","mantis.meta.timestamp":1570396603342,"status":500}

data: {"country":"Liberia","mantis.meta.sourceName":"SyntheticRequestSource","mantis.meta.timestamp":1570396603844,"status":500}
```

## Next Steps

* Import the project into your IDE to explore the code.
* Try out other samples from the [Mantis examples repository](https://github.com/netflix/mantis-examples).
* [Set up Mantis locally using Docker](docker.md) and run the samples.
* [Set up Mantis in AWS](cloud.md) and run the samples.
* Learn to write your [first Mantis Job](../../develop/writing-jobs/word-count.md).
