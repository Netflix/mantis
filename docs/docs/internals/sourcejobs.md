Mantis Source Jobs are [Mantis Jobs] that fetch data from external sources. There are four types of
Source Jobs:

1. **Mantis Publish Source Jobs**
   read from their sources by using [Mantis Publish](../mre). As such, they do not apply [MQL](../MQL) on events
   themselves. Instead, they propagate the MQL queries upstream to Mantis Publish running on the external
   source, which then applies the MQL queries to the events it produces and only then pushes those
   events downstream to the Request Source Job.

2. **Kafka Source Jobs**
   consume events from [Kafka] and apply MQL to each incoming event.

## Composition of a Source Job
A Source Job is composed of three components:

1. the default [Source]
1. custom [Processing Stages] including a tagging operator
1. the default [Sink] consisting of an [SSE] operator

For example, here is how you might declare a Kafka Source Job:

```java hl_lines="2 3 4 5 6 7 8"
MantisJob
  .source(KafkaSource)
  .stage(
     getAckableTaggingStage(),
     CustomizedAutoAckTaggingStage.config())
  .sink(new TaggedDataSourceSink(
     new QueryRequestPreProcessor(),
     new QueryRequestPostProcessor()))
  .lifecycle(...)
  .create();
```

### Source (RxFunction)
The Source in this example contains code that creates and manages connections to Kafka using the
0.10 high level consumer. It creates an [Observable] with [backpressure] semantics by leveraging the
[`SyncOnSubscribe`](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/observables/SyncOnSubscribe.html) class.

### Processing Stage (RxFunction)
The next stage in this Job is the Processing Stage which enriches events with [metadata]. This stage
[transforms] events in the following way:

1. Applies a user-defined pre-mapping function.
    - This is a Groovy function that takes a `Map<String, Object>` and returns a
      `Map<String, Object>` referenced by a variable named `e`.
2. Filters out empty events.
3. Inspects its internal subscription registry and enriches each event with all matching
   subscriptions.
    - Subscriptions are represented by an MQL query and are registered when a consumer (e.g. Mantis
      Job) subscribes to the Source Job.
    - Each event is enriched with fields specified by the projections of a subscription’s MQL query,
      as in the following illustration:

        ![If an event matches multiple subscriptions, then the event will be enriched with projections from every subscription’s MQL query.](../images/RequestEventProcessor.svg)

### Sink (RxAction)
In order for a consumer to consume events from a Source Job, the consumer connects to the Job’s Sink.

Consumers subscribe to a Source Job by sending a subscription request over HTTP to the Source Job’s Sink.

When a consumer connects to a Sink, the consumer must provide three query parameters:

1. `criterion` — An MQL query string
2. `clientId` — This is automatically generated if you use the Mantis client library; it defaults to
   the Mantis Job ID
3. `subscriptionId` — This is used as a load-balancing mechanism for `clientId`

A consumer (represented as a client through `clientId`) may have many consumer instances
(represented as susbcriptions through `subscriptionId`). Source Jobs use `clientId` and
`subscriptionId` to **broadcast** and/or **load balance** events to consumers.

Source Jobs will **broadcast** an event to all `clientId`s. This means that consumer instances with
different `clientId`s will each receive the same event.

However, Source Jobs will **load balance** an event within a `clientId`. This means that consumer
instances with the same `clientId` but different `subscriptionId`s are effectively grouped together.
Events with the same `clientId` are load balanced among its `subscriptionId`s.

<div class="commandline">
 <span class="comment">Example of subscribing to a Source Job’s Sink which outputs the results of a sine wave function:</span><br />
 <span class="command prompted">curl "http://<var>instance-address</var>:<var>port</var>?clientId=<var>myId</var>&subscriptionId=<var>mySubscription</var>&criterion=select%20*%20where%20true"</span><br /><pre>

data: {"x": 60.000000, "y": -3.048106}

data: {"x": 100.000000, "y": -5.063656}

data: {"x": 26.000000, "y": 7.625585}

⋮</pre>
</div>

Sinks have a pre-processor (`QueryRequestPreProcessor`), a post-processor
(`QueryRequestPostProcessor`), and a router:

* The **pre-processor** is an RxFunction that registers the consumer’s query, with their `clientId`
  and `subscriptionId`, into an in-memory cache called a `QueryRefCountMap` when a consumer instance
  connects to the Sink. This registers queries so that the Source Job can apply them to events as
  those events are ingested by the Source Job.

* The **post-processor** is an RxFunction that de-registers subscriptions from the
  `QueryRefCountMap` when a consumer instance disconnects from the Sink. The Source Job removes
  removes the `clientId` entirely from the `QueryRefCountMap` only when all of its `subscriptionId`s
  have been removed.

* The **router** routes incoming events for a `clientId`s to its subscriptions. It does this by
  using a **drainer** called a `ChunkProcessor` to drain events from an internal queue on an
  interval and randomly distribute the events to subscriptions.

!!! note
    Typically, subscriptions to a Source Job come from other Mantis Jobs. However, because
    subscriptions are SSE endpoints, you can subscribe to Source Jobs over that same SSE endpoint to
    view the Job’s output for debugging purposes.

## Caveats
Source Jobs are single-stage Mantis Jobs that perform projection and filtering operations. MQL
queries containing `groupBy`, `orderBy`, and `window` are ignored. These clauses are interpreted
into [RxJava] operations and run by downstream Mantis Jobs.

Mantis Publish-based Source Jobs do not [autoscale]. Autoscaling Mantis Publish-based Source Jobs requires future work to
reshuffle connections among all Source Job instances and their upstream Mantis Publish connections.
