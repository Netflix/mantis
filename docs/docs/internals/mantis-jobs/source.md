To implement a [Mantis Job]  [Source]  [component], you must implement the
`io.mantisrx.runtime.Source` interface. A Source returns `Observable<Observable<T>>`, that is, an
[Observable] that emits Observables. Each of the emitted Observables represents a stream of data
from a single target server.

## Varieties of Sources

Sources can be roughly divided into two categories:

1. Sources that read data from the output of other Mantis Jobs
    1. this may include [Source Jobs] (more on this below)
    1. or ordinary Mantis Jobs
1. Custom sources that read data directly from Amazon S3, SQS, Apache [Kafka], etc.

<!-- You can find more information on sources in [Mantis Data Sources](https://confluence.netflix.com/display/API/Mantis+Data+Sources) <span class="tbd">Incorporate that document into this docs set or omit the link.</span> -->

### Mantis Job Sources

You can string Mantis Jobs together by using the output of one Mantis Job as the input to another.
This is useful if you want to break up your processing into multiple, reusable components and to
take advantage of code and data reuse.

In such a case, you do not have access to the complete set of [Mantis Query Language (MQL)](../../mql)
capabilities that you do in the case of a Source Job, but you can use MQL in client mode.

#### Connecting to a Mantis Job

To connect to a Mantis Job,
use a [`JobSource`](https://github.com/Netflix/mantis-connectors/blob/master/mantis-connector-job/src/main/java/io/mantisrx/connector/job/source/JobSource.java) when you call `MantisJob.create()` — declare the following parameters when you use this class:

1. `sourceJobName` *(required)* — the name of any valid [Job Cluster] (not necessarily a “Source Job”) <!-- MANTIS_SOURCEJOB_NAME_PARAM -->
1. `sample` *(optional)* — use this if you want to [sample] the output `sample` times per second, or set this to `-1` to disable sampling <!-- MANTIS_SOURCEJOB_SAMPLE_PER_SEC_KEY -->

For example:

```java
MantisJob.source(new JobSource())
         .stage(…)
         .sink(…)
         .parameterDefinition(new StringParameter().name("sourceJobName")
            .description("The name of the job")
            .validator(Validators.notNullOrEmpty())
            .defaultValue("MyDefaultJob")
            .build())
         .parameterDefinition(new IntParameter().name("sample")
            .description("The number of samples per second")
            .validator(Validators.range(-1, 10000))
            .defaultValue(-1)
            .build())
         .lifecycle(…)
         .metadata(…)
         .create();
```

### Source Job Sources

Mantis has a concept of [Source Jobs] which are Mantis [Jobs] with added conveniences and efficiences
that simplify accessing data from certain sources. Your job can simply connect to a source job as its
data source rather than trying to retrieve the data from its native home.
There are two advantages to this approach:

1. Source Jobs handle all of the implementation details around interacting with the native data
   source.
1. Source Jobs come with a simple query interface based on the [Mantis Query Language (MQL)](../../mql),
   which allows you to filter the data from the source before processing it. In the case of source
   jobs that fetch data from application servers directly, this filter gets pushed all the way to
   those target servers so that no data flows unless someone is asking for it.
1. Source Jobs reuse data so that multiple matching MQL queries are forwarded downstream instead of
   paying the cost to fetch and serialize/deserialize the same data multiple times from the upstream
   source.

#### Broadcast Mode

By default, Mantis will distribute the data that is output from the Source Job among the various
workers in the processing stage of your Mantis Job. Each of those workers will get a subset of the
complete data from the Source Job.

You can override this by instructing the Source Job to use “broadcast mode”. If you do this, Mantis
will send the complete set of data from the Source Job to *every* worker in your Job.

#### Connecting to a Source Job

Since Source Jobs are fundamentally Mantis Jobs, you should
use a [`JobSource`](https://github.com/Netflix/mantis-connectors/blob/master/mantis-connector-job/src/main/java/io/mantisrx/connector/job/source/JobSource.java) when you call `MantisJob.create()` to connect to a particular Source Job.
The difference is that you should pass in additional parameters:

1. `sourceJobName` *(required)* — the name of the source Job Cluster you want to connect to
1. `sample` *(required)* — use this if you want to [sample] the output `sample` times per second, or set this to `-1` to disable sampling
1. `criterion` *(required)* — a query expression in [MQL](../../mql) to filter the source
1. `clientId` *(optional)* — by default, the `jobId` of the client Job; the Source Job uses this to distribute data between all the subscriptions of the client Job
1. `enableMetaMessages` *(optional)* — the source job may occasionally inject [meta messages] (with the prefix `mantis.meta.`) that indicate things like data drops on the Source Job side.

For example:

```java
MantisJob.source(new JobSource())
         .stage(…)
         .sink(…)
         .parameterDefinition(new StringParameter().name("sourceJobName")
            .description("The name of the job")
            .validator(Validators.notNullOrEmpty())
            .defaultValue("MyDefaultSourceJob")
            .build())
         .parameterDefinition(new IntParameter().name("sample")
            .description("The number of samples per second")
            .validator(Validators.range(-1, 10000))
            .defaultValue(-1)
            .build())
         .parameterDefinition(new StringParameter().name("criterion")
            .description("Filter the source with this MQL statement")
            .validator(Validators.notNullOrEmpty())
            .defaultValue("true")
            .build())
         .parameterDefinition(new StringParameter().name("clientId")
            .description("the ID of the client job")
            .validator(Validators.alwaysPass())
            .build())
         .parameterDefinition(new BooleanParameter().name("enableMetaMessages")
            .description("Is the source allowed to inject meta messages")
            .validator(Validators.alwaysPass())
            .defaultValue("true")
            .build())
         .lifecycle(…)
         .metadata(…)
         .create();
```

### Custom Sources

[Custom sources] may be implemented and used to access data sources for which Mantis does not have a Source Job.
Implementers are free to implement the [Source](https://github.com/Netflix/mantis/blob/master/mantis-runtime/src/main/java/io/mantisrx/runtime/source/Source.java) interface to fetch data from an external source.
[Here](https://github.com/Netflix/mantis-connectors/blob/master/mantis-connector-kafka/src/main/java/io/mantisrx/connector/kafka/source/KafkaSource.java) is an example in a source which implements the Source interface to consume data from Kafka.

## Learning When Source Data is Incomplete

You may want to know whether or not the stream you are receiving from your [source] is complete.
Streams may be incomplete for a number of reasons:

1. A connection to one or more of the [Source Job]  [workers] is lost.
2. A connection exists but no data is flowing.
3. Data is intentionally dropped from a source because of the [backpressure] strategy you are using.

You can use the following `boolean` method within your `JobSource#call` method to determine whether or not all of your client
connections are complete:

```java
DefaultSinkConnectionStatusObserver.getInstance(true).isConnectedToAllSinks()
```
