The Mantis Runtime is consists of two components:

1. A single **[Mantis Master]** which coordinates the execution of [Mantis Jobs].
1. Independent **Mantis Jobs** which receive streams of events as input, [transform] events one at a
   time, and produce streams of events as output.

This page assumes familiarity with Mantis Job high-level concepts. An introduction can be found in
[Writing Mantis Jobs](../writingjobs). This page presents internal details for Mantis Jobs.

## Mantis Job Components
A Mantis Job consists of three [components]. Each one is based on a [cold Observable] that emits
events to the next Observer in the Observable chain:

1. **Source**

    The [Source] component is an `RxFunction` that consumes data in a streaming, non-blocking,
    [backpressure]-aware manner from an external service.

1. **Processing Stage**

    A [Processing Stage] component is based on an `RxFunction`. This is where
    event transformations take place. There can be many Processing Stages in a Mantis Job.

1. **Sink**

    The [Sink] component is based on an `RxAction`. It asynchronously emits results of the
    final Processing Stage to an external service.

!!! note
    Mantis Jobs can consume events from typical external services such as APIs, databases, and
    [Kafka] topics. Mantis Jobs can also consume events emitted by other Mantis Jobs. This is
    referred to in Mantis as **job chaining**.

## Runtime Lifecycle
The entry point for a Mantis Job is the Mantis [Worker]. The Mantis Master starts three primary
services on a Mantis Worker when the Master boots the Worker up:

1. The **virtual machine worker** service interacts with the underlying substrate, currently
   [Mesos]. This service subscribes to task updates and registers the Mantis Worker with Mesos
   executor callbacks to launch Mantis Jobs.

1. The **heartbeat service** sends HTTP heartbeat requests to notify the Mantis Master that the
   worker is alive and available to process events.

1. The **stage executor** dynamically loads bytecode for a Mantis Job, creates an in-memory
   representation of all the [metadata] required to execute events for that Mantis Job, and
   processes events for the current Processing Stage.

### Job Master Stage
The [Job Master]  [autoscales] Processing Stages. It can autoscale such stages independently of each
other. If the configuration of a Job indicates that any Processing Stage is autoscalable, Mantis
will automatically add a Job Master as the initial processing stage of the Job. This is a hidden
stage that Job owners do not explicitly manage; instead, Mantis will create and configure a
`JobMasterService`. This service creates a subscription to worker metrics via the
`WorkerMetricHandler` and a `MetricsClient` which receives metrics over HTTP via [SSE] and sends
them over to the `JobAutoScaler`.

#### Job Autoscaler
The Job autoscaler is based on a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller).
Within this autoscaler are three controllers for CPU, memory, and network resources which
continuously calculate an error value and apply corrections. Once the autoscaler makes a prediction,
it delegates an API call to the Mantis Master to perform the scaling action on resources for a
Processing stage.

### Single-Stage and Multi-Stage Jobs
A Job with only one Processing Stage is a single-stage Job. In such a case, the entire Job (Source,
Processing Stage, and Sink) will execute on the current worker node.

A Job with more than one Processing Stage is a multi-stage Job. In such a Job, the stage executor
will first inspect the current component. If the current component is a Source, then the executor
will execute it as a Source. Otherwise, it will inspect the context again to determine if current
component is a Sink. If so, it will acquire a port and create a `SinkPublisher` to publish events to
the next Job. Finally, if the component is a normal Processing Stage, then the executor will execute
its transformations.
