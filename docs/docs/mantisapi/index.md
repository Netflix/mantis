In addition to the Mantis UI, there is a REST API with which you can maintain
[Mantis Jobs] and [Job Clusters]. This page describes the open source version of the Mantis REST
API.

You can use the Mantis REST API to submit Jobs based on existing Job Cluster or to connect to the
output of running Jobs. It is easier to set up or update new Job Clusters by using the Mantis UI,
but you can also do this with the Mantis REST API.

## Summary of REST API

## Cluster Tasks

<p class="tbd">TBD</p>
### Get a List of Clusters
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters</code> (`GET`)**

To retrieve a list of JSON objects that include details about the available Job Clusters, issue a `GET` command to the Mantis REST API endpoint `/api/v1/jobClusters/`.

???question "Query Parameters"
    | Query Parameter        | Purpose |
    | ---------------------- | ------- |
    | `ascending` (optional) | You can use this to indicate whether or not to sort the records in ascending order (`true` | `false`). |
    | `fields` (optional)    | By default this endpoint will return all of the fields in the payload. You can set `fields` to a comma-delimited series of payload fields, in which case this endpoint will return only those fields of the payload. For example `?fields=name`. |
    | `offset` (optional)    | The record number to begin with in the set of records to return in this request (use this with `pageSize` to get records by the page). See [Pagination](#pagination) for more details. |
    | `pageSize` (optional)  | The maximum number of records to return in this request (default = 0, which means all records). See [Pagination](#pagination) for more details. |
    | `sortBy` (optional)    | You can set this to the name of any payload field whose values are `Comparable` and this endpoint will return its results sorted by that field. |
    | `matching` (optional)  | You can set this to a regular expression, and Mantis will filter the list of Job Clusters on the server side, and will return only those that match this expression. |

???abstract "Example Response Format"
    **`GET /api/v1/jobClusters?pageSize=5&fields=name&sortBy=name&ascending=false`**

        {
          "list":
            [{"name":"jschmoeSLATest"},
             {"name":"sinefn"},
             {"name":"Validation_ZV93BAWR2"},
             {"name":"Validation_Z8NB06L1A"},
             {"name":"Validation_Y828QAI01"}],
          "prev":null,
          "next":"/api/v1/jobClusters?pageSize=5&fields=name&sortBy=name&ascending=false&offset=5"
        }

???info "Possible Response Codes"
    | Response Code | Reason |
    | ------------- | ------ |
    | `200`         | normal response |
    | `405`         | incorrect HTTP verb (use `GET` instead) |
    | `500`         | unknown server error |

### Create a New Cluster
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters</code> (`POST`)**

Before you submit a [Mantis Job], you must first have set up a [Job Cluster]. A Job Cluster contains
a unique name for the Job, a URL of the Job’s `.jar` or `.zip` artifact file, resource requirements
to run your Job, and other optional information such as [SLA] values for minimum and maximum Jobs to
keep active for this Cluster, or a cron-based schedule to launch a Job for this Cluster. Each new
Job can be considered as an instance of the Job Cluster, and is given a unique ID by appending a
number suffix to the Cluster name. The Job inherits the resource requirements from the Cluster
unless whoever submits the Job overrides these at submit time.

A Job Cluster name must match this regular expression: `^[A-Za-z]+[A-Za-z0-9+-_=:;]*`

To create a new Job Cluster, issue a POST command to the Mantis REST API endpoint
`/api/v1/jobClusters` with a request body that matches format of the following example:

    | `409`         | cluster name already exists |
    | `500`         | unknown server error |

#### Setting Jobs to Launch at Particular Times
You can use the `cronSpec` field in the body of this request to specify when to launch the Jobs in
the Cluster. By default this is blank (`""`).

If you set `cronSpec` to a non-blank value, this also sets the `min` and `max` values for the Job
Cluster to 0 and 1 respectively. That is to say, you can have no more than one Job running at any
one time for that Cluster.

Optionally, you can provide a policy (`cronpolicy`) to use when a cron trigger fires while a
previosuly submitted Job for the Job Cluster is still running. The possible policy values are
`KEEP_EXISTING` (do not replace the current Job) and `KEEP_NEW` (replace the current Job with a new
one). The default policy is `KEEP_EXISTING`.

!!!note
    If the [Mantis Master] is down during a time window when cron would normally have fired, that
    cron trigger time window is lost. Mantis does not check for this upon restart. The next cron
    trigger will resume normally.

### Change Information about a Cluster
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var></code> (`PUT`)**

To update an existing [Job Cluster], send a `PUT` command to the Mantis REST API endpoint
<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var></code> with the same sort of body described above
in the case of a Job Cluster create operation. Increment the version number so as to differentiate
your new Cluster from the previous Job [artifacts]. If you try to update an existing Job Cluster by
reusing the version number of an existing one, the operation will fail.

### Delete a Cluster
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var></code> (`DELETE`)**

To permanently delete an existing [Job Cluster], send a `DELETE` command to the Mantis REST API
endpoint <code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var></code>.

???question "Query Parameters"
    | Query Parameter   | Purpose |

-----

### Update a Cluster’s Artifacts
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/updateArtifact</code> (`POST`)**

You can make a “quick update” of an existing [Job Cluster] and also submit a new [Job] with the
updated cluster [artifacts]. This lets you update the Job Cluster with minimal information, without
having to specify the scheduling info, as long as at least one Job was previously submitted for this
Job Cluster. Mantis copies the scheduling information, Job [parameters], and so forth, from the last
Job submitted.

To do this, send a `POST` command to the Mantis REST API endpoint
<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/updateArtifact</code> with a body that
matches the format of the following example:

???abstract "Example Request Body"
        {
          "name": "ValidatorDemo",
          "version": "0.0.1 2019-02-06 11:30:49",
          "url": "mantis-artifacts/demo-0.0.1-dev201901231434.zip",
          "skipsubmit": false,
          "user": "jschmoe"
        }

???abstract "Example Response Format"
    <p class="tbd">TBD</p>

???info "Possible Response Codes"
    | Response Code | Reason |
    | ------------- | ------ |
    | `204`         | normal response |
    | `404`         | no cluster with the given cluster name was found |
    | `405`         | incorrect HTTP verb (use `POST` instead) |
    | `500`         | unknown server error |

You will receive in the response the Job ID of the newly submitted Job (unless you set `skipsubmit`
to `true` in the request body, in which case no such Job will be created).

-----

### Update a Cluster’s SLA
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/updateSla</code> (`POST`)**

To update the [SLA] of a [Job Cluster] without having to submit a new version, send a `POST` command
to the Mantis REST API endpoint
<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/updateSla</code> with a body that matches
the format of the following example:

???abstract "Example Request Body"
        { 
          "user": "YourUserName",
          "name": "Foo",
          "min": 0,
          "max": 2,
          "cronspec": "5 * * * * ?",
          "cronpolicy": "KEEP_EXISTING",
          "forceenable": true
        }

The fields of this body are as follows:

| SLA Field     | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------- |
| `user`        | (required) name of the user calling this endpoint |
| `name`        | (required) name of the Job Cluster |
| `min`         | minimum number of [Jobs] to keep running |
| `max`         | maximum number of Jobs to allow running simultaneously |
| `cronspec`    | cron specification, see below for format and examples |
| `cronpolicy`  | either `KEEP_EXISTING` or `KEEP_NEW` (see above for details) |
| `forceenable` | either `true` or `false`; reenable the Job Cluster if it is in the disabled state |

!!! note
    While `min`, `max`, `cronspec`, `cronpolicy`, and `forceenable` are all optional fields, you
    should provide at minimum either `cronspec` or the combination of `min` & `max`.

The cron specification string is defined by [Quartz CronTrigger](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger). Here are some examples:

???example "Examples of `cronspec` Values"
    | example `cronspec` value                                 | resulting job trigger time |
    | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
    | <code style="white-space:nowrap">"0 0 12 * * ?"</code>   | Fire at 12&nbsp;p.m. (noon) every day. |
    | <code style="white-space:nowrap">"0 15 10 ? * *"</code>  | Fire at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. every day. |
    | <code style="white-space:nowrap">"0 15 10 * * ?"</code>  | Fire at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. every day. |
    | <code style="white-space:nowrap">"0 0-5 14 * * ?"</code> | Fire every minute starting at 2&nbsp;p.m. and ending at 2:05&nbsp;p.m., every day. |

Scheduling information for Jobs launched by means of cron triggers is inherited from the scheduling
information for the Job Cluster.

!!! warning
    If a Job takes required [parameters], the Job will not launch successfully if the Job Cluster
    does not establish defaults for those parameters. A Job launched by means of a cron trigger
    always uses these default parameters to launch the Job.

If you provide an invalid cron specification, this will disable the Job Cluster. To fix this, when
you reformulate your cron specification, also set `forceenable` to `"true"` in the body that you
send via `POST` to <code>/api/v2/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/updateSla</code>.

### Update a Cluster’s Migration Strategy
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/updateMigrationStrategy</code> (`POST`)**

You can quickly update the [migration strategy] of an existing [Job Cluster] without having to
update the entirety of the Cluster definition. To do this, send a `POST` command to the Mantis REST
API endpoint <code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/updateMigrationStrategy</code>
with a body that matches the format of the following example:

???abstract "Example Request Body"
        {

### Enable a Cluster
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/enableCluster</code> (`POST`)**

You can quickly change the state of an existing [Job Cluster] to `enabled=true` without having to
update the entirety of the Cluster definition.

To do this, send a `POST` command to the Mantis REST API endpoint
<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/enableCluster</code> with a body that
matches the format of the following example:

???abstract "Example Request Body"
        {

### Disable a Cluster
* **<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/disableCluster</code> (`POST`)**

You can quickly change the state of an existing [Job Cluster] to `enabled=false` without having to
update the entirety of the Cluster definition.

When you disable a Job Cluster Mantis will not allow new [Job] submissions under that Cluster and
it will terminate any Jobs from that Cluster that are currently running. Mantis will also stop
enforcing the [SLA] requirements for the Cluster, including any cron setup that would otherwise
launch new Jobs.

This is useful when a Job Cluster must be temporarily made inactive, for instance if you have
determined that there is a problem with it.

To do this, send a `POST` command to the Mantis REST API endpoint
<code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/actions/disableCluster</code> with a body that
matches the format of the following example:

???abstract "Example Request Body"
        {

## Job Tasks

<p class="tbd">TBD</p>
### Get a List of Jobs
* **<code>/api/v1/jobs</code> (`GET`)**

To retrieve a JSON array of IDs of the active [Jobs], issue a `GET` command to the Mantis REST API
endpoint <code>/api/v1/jobs</code>.

???question "Query Parameters"
    | Query Parameter        | Purpose |
    | ---------------------- | ------- |
    | `ascending` (optional) | You can use this to indicate whether or not to sort the records in ascending order (`true` | `false`; default=`false`). |
    | `compact` (optional)   | Ask the server to return compact responses (`true` | `false`; default=`false`). |
    | `fields` (optional)    | By default this endpoint will return all of the fields in the payload. You can set `fields` to a comma-delimited series of payload fields, in which case this endpoint will return only those fields in the response. |
    | `limit` (optional)     | The maximum record size to return (default = no limit). |
    | `offset` (optional)    | The record number to begin with in the set of records to return in this request (use this with `pageSize` to get records by the page). See [Pagination](#pagination) for more details. |
    | `pageSize` (optional)  | The maximum number of records to return in this request (default = 0, which means all records). See [Pagination](#pagination) for more details. |
    | `sortBy` (optional)    | You can set this to the name of any payload field whose values are `Comparable` and this endpoint will return its results sorted by that field. |

    There is also a series of query parameters that you can use to set server-side filters that will restrict the jobs represented in the resulting list of jobs to only those jobs that match the filters:

    | Query Parameter            | What It Filters |
    | -------------------------- | --------------- | 
    | `activeOnly` (optional)    | The `activeOnly` field (boolean). By default, this is `true`. |
    | `jobState` (optional)      | Job state, `Active` or `Terminal`. By default, this endpoint filters on `jobState=Active`. This query parameter has precedence over the `activeOnly` parameter. |
    | `labels` (optional)        | Labels in the `labels` array. You can express this by setting this parameter to a comma-delimited list of label strings. |
    | `labels.op` (optional)     | Use this parameter to tell the server whether to treat the list of `labels` you have provided as an `or` (default: a job that contains *any* of the labels will be returned in the list), or an `and` (only jobs that contain *all* of the labels will be returned). Set this to `or` or `and`. |
    | `matching` (optional)      | The cluster name. Set this to a regex string. You can also use the <code>/api/v1/jobClusters/<var>clusterName</var>/jobs</code> endpoint if you mean to match a specific cluster name and do not need the flexibility of a regex filter. |
    | `stageNumber` (optional)   | Stage number (integer). This filters the list to contain only those jobs corresponding to workers that are relevant to the specified stage. |
    | `workerIndex` (optional)   | The `workerIndex` field (integer). |
    | `workerNumber` (optional)  | The `workerNumber` field (integer). |
    | `workerState` (optional)   | The `workerState` field (`Noop`, `Active` (default), or `Terminal`) |

### Update a Job Cluster and Submit a New Job at the Same Time
* **<code>/api/v1/jobs/actions/quickSubmit</code> (`POST`)**

You can make a “quick update” of an existing [Job Cluster] and also submit a new [Job] with the
updated cluster [artifacts]. This lets you update the Job Cluster with minimal information, without
having to specify the scheduling info, as long as at least one Job was previously submitted for this
Job Cluster.

To do this, send a `POST` command to the Mantis REST API endpoint
<code>/api/v1/jobs/actions/quickSubmit</code> with a body that matches the format
of the following example:

???abstract "Example Request Body"
        {
          "name": "NameOfJobCluster",
          "user": "myusername",

            "minRuntimeSecs": "0",
            "userProvidedType": ""
          }

### Horizontally Scale a Stage
* **<code>/api/v1/jobs/<var>jobID</var>/actions/scaleStage</code> (`POST`)**

To manually scale a [Job]  [Processing Stage], that is, to alter the number of [workers] assigned to
that stage, send a `POST` command to the Mantis REST API endpoint
<code>/api/v1/jobs/<var>jobID</var>/actions/scaleStage</code> with a request body in the following
format:

!!! note
    You can only manually scale a Processing Stage if the Job was submitted with the `scalable` flag
    turned on.

???abstract "Example Request Body"
        {
          "JobId": "ValidatorDemo-33",
          "StageNumber": 1,
          "NumWorkers": 3
        }

    `NumWorkers` here is the *number* of workers you want to be assigned to the stage after the
    scaling action takes place (that is, it is *not* the *delta* by which you want to change the
    number of workers in the stage).

          "workerNumber": 5,
          "reason": "test worker resubmit"
        }

    !!! note
        `workerNumber` is the worker *number* not the worker *index*.

## Pagination

You can configure some endpoints to return their responses in *pages*. This is to say that rather
than returning all of the data responsive to a request all at once, the endpoint can return a
specific subset of the data at a time.

An endpoint that supports pagination will typically do so by means of two query parameters:

| Query Parameter | Purpose |
| --------------- | ------- |
| `pageSize`      | the maximum number of records to return in this request (default = 0, which means all records) |
| `offset`        | the record number to begin with in the set of records to return in this request |

So, for example, you might make consecutive requests for…

1. <code><var>endpoint</var>?pageSize=10&offset=0</code>
1. <code><var>endpoint</var>?pageSize=10&offset=10</code>
1. <code><var>endpoint</var>?pageSize=10&offset=20</code>

…and so forth, until you reach the final page of records.

When you request records in a paginated fashion like this, the Mantis API will enclose them in a
JSON structure like the following:

<div class="codeblock">
{
  "list": [
    {
      "Id": <var>originalOffset</var>,
      ⋮
    },
    {
      "Id": <var>originalOffset+1</var>,
      ⋮
    },
    ⋮
  ],
  "prev": "/api/v1/<var>endpoint</var>?pageSize=<var>pageSize</var>&offset=<var>originalOffset+pageSize</var>",
  "next": "/api/v1/<var>endpoint</var>?pageSize=<var>pageSize</var>&offset=<var>originalOffset−pageSize</var>"
}
</div>

For example:

```json
{
  "list": [
    {
      "Id": 101,
      ⋮
    },
    {
      "Id": 102,
      ⋮
    }
  ],
  "next": "/api/v1/someResource?pageSize=20&offset=120",
  "prev": "/api/v1/someResource?pageSize=20&offset=80"
}
```

`prev` and/or `next` will be `null` if there is no previous or next page, that is, if you are at the
first and/or last page in the pagination.
