Similar to micro-services deployed in a cloud, Mantis applications (jobs) are deployed on the Mantis platform. The Mantis platform provides the APIs to manage the life cycle of jobs (like deploy, update, and terminate), manages the underlying resources by containerizing a common pool of servers, and, similar to a traditional micro-service cloud, allows jobs to discover and communicate with other jobs. By providing stream processing As-a-Service, Mantis allows developers to simply focus on their business logic to build powerful and cost-effective streaming applications. Why We Built Mantis \u00b6 Mantis evolved from the need to get better (faster and in-depth) operational insights in a rapidly growing, complex, micro-service ecosystem at Netflix. As complexity of a system increases, our comprehension of the system rapidly decreases. In order to counter this complexity we need new approaches to operational insights. We need to change the way we generate and collect operational data: We should have access to raw events. Applications should be free to publish every single event. If we reduce the granularity at this stage, such as by pre-aggregating or sampling, then we\u2019re already at a disadvantage when it comes to getting insight since the data in its original form is already lost. We should be able to access this data in realtime. Operational use cases are inherently time-sensitive by nature. This becomes increasingly important with scale as the impact becomes much larger in less time. We should be able to ask new questions of this data without necessarily having to add new instrumentation to our applications. It\u2019s not possible to know ahead of time every single possible failure mode our systems might encounter despite all the rigor built in to make these systems resilient. When these failures do inevitably occur, it\u2019s important that we can derive new insights with this data. We need a new kind of execution environment : Can Process high volume data at low latency Has low Operational burden We need a managed platform where most of the operational tasks are handled automatically on behalf of the user. We don\u2019t need the additional overhead of operating our monitoring system. Is Elastic and Resilient We need a highly reliable system that can automatically recover from node failures and be able to scale the resources dynamically based on the data volume. Ecosystem of Streaming services A lot of use-cases often need the same data. By allowing jobs to discover each other and collaborate together by sharing data and results we can build cost-effective jobs that maximise code and data re-use. We should be able to do all of the above in a cost-effective way . As our business critical systems scale, we need to make sure the systems in support of these business critical systems don\u2019t end up costing more than the business critical systems themselves. Mantis was built to meet all the above needs. It was designed by Netflix . How Can Mantis Be Used? \u00b6 Mantis provides a robust, scalable platform that is ideally suited for high volume, low latency use cases like anomaly detection and alerting. Mantis has been in production at Netflix since 2014. It processes trillions of events and peta-bytes of data every day. As a streaming microservices ecosystem, the Mantis platform provides engineers with capabilities to minimize the costs of observing and operating complex distributed systems without compromising on operational insights. Engineers can build cost-efficient real-time applications on top of Mantis to quickly identify issues, trigger alerts, and apply remediations to minimize or completely avoid downtime to the Netflix service.

Allowing jobs to communicate with other jobs promotes code and data reuse thus improving efficiency and productivity as users do not have to re-invent the wheel . Additionally, Mantis jobs can, with the help of the mantis-publish library, source data directly from production systems in an on-demand fashion. This provides a cost effective option to access rich operational data which otherwise would be prohibitive to transport and store (Imagine having to transport and store request and response bodies for every single request) So the answer is a qualified yes but it is much more than a stream processing engine. Does Mantis process events in micro batches or event a time ? \u00b6 By default Mantis Jobs process events one at a time. Users can however create their own micro batches using ReactiveX operators. What kind of message guarantees does Mantis support ? \u00b6 The default delivery semantic is at-most once. This is intentional as the majority of the use cases on Mantis are latency sensitive (think alerting.) where determining an aggregate trend in subsecond latency is preferred to data completeness albeit with potential delay. In cases where the source of data is Kafka, Mantis supports at-least once semantics. The exactly-once or effectively once semantic support is currently not available in Open Source. Do Mantis Jobs operate in event time or clock time ? \u00b6 By default Mantis jobs operate with clock time. How does Mantis deal with backpressure ? \u00b6 Mantis relies on the backpressure support built-in to RxJava. This ensures an upstream operator in the execution DAG will not send more events down until the downstream consumer is ready. Thus backpressure bubbles up along the DAG to the edge where data is being fetched from across the network. At this point, the strategy depends on whether the external source of data is cold source like a queue or database or a hot source like data sent via [mantis-publish]. For [cold] sources like Kafka no more events are read until the previous batch of events have been acknowledged. For [hot] sources events are first buffered and then as a last resort dropped. One effective way to deal with backpressure in Mantis, is to enable [autoscale] on the job with a strategy to scale up on backpressure. Is it possible to use the second [stage] of a three-stage [Mantis Job] as the [source job] for another [MQL] job? \u00b6 Jobs connect to the [sink] stage of other jobs by default, so while it may be technically possible to rig up a solution where you connect to an intermediate stage instead, this is not supported as an out-of-the-box solution.

Cluster A Job Cluster is a containing entity for [Mantis Jobs]. It defines metadata and certain [service-level agreements]. Job Clusters ease job lifecycle management and job revisioning. A Mantis Cluster is a group of cloud container instances that hold your Mantis resources. cold Observables A cold [ReactiveX] [Observable] waits until an observer subscribes to it before it begins to emit items. This means the observer is guaranteed to see the whole Observable sequence from the beginning. This is in contrast to a hot Observable, which may begin emitting items as soon as it is created, even before observers have subscribed to it. component A Mantis [Job] is composed of three types of component: a [Source], one or more [Processing Stages], and a [Sink]. Custom source In contrast to a [Source Job], which is a built-in variety of [Source] [component] designed to pull data from a common sort of data source, a custom source typically accesses data from less-common sources or has unusual delivery guarantee semantics. Executor The stage executor is responsible for loading the bytecode for a [Mantis Job] and then executing its [stages] and [workers] in a coordinated fashion. In the [Mesos] UI, workers are also referred to as executors. Fenzo Fenzo is a Java library that implements a generic task scheduler for [Mesos] frameworks. \u21d2 See the Fenzo documentation . grouped data Grouped (or keyed) data is distinguished from [scalar] data in that each datum is accompanied by a key that indicates what group it belongs to. Grouped data can be processed by a [RxJava] GroupedObservable or by a MantisGroup . GRPC GRPC is an open-source RPC framework using Protocol Buffers. \u21d2 See GRPC.io hot Observables A hot [ReactiveX] [Observable] may begin emitting items as soon as it is created, even before observers have subscribed to it. This means the observer may miss items that were emitted before the observer subscribed. This is in contrast to a cold Observable, which waits until an observer subscribes to it before it begins to emit items. JMC Java Mission Control is a tool from Oracle with which developers can monitor and manage Java applications. \u21d2 See Java Components Job A Mantis Job takes in a stream of data, transforms it by using [RxJava] operators, and then outputs the results as another stream. It is composed of a [Source], one or more [Processing Stages], and a [Sink]. \u21d2 See Writing Mantis Jobs Job Cluster see [Cluster] Job Master If a job is configured with [autoscaling], Mantis will add a Job Master component to it as its initial component. This component will send metrics back to Mantis to help it govern the autoscaling process. Kafka Apache Kafka is a large-scale, distributed streaming platform. \u21d2 See Apache Kafka . keyed data see [grouped data] Keystone Keystone is Netflix\u2019s data backbone, a stream processing platform that focuses on data analytics. \u21d2 See Keystone Real-time Stream Processing Platform label A label is a text key/value pair that you can add to a [Job Cluster] or to an individual [Job] to make it easier to search for or group. Log4j Log4j is a Java-based logging framework. \u21d2 See Apache Log4j Mantis Master The Mantis Master coordinates the execution of [Mantis Jobs] and starts the services on each [Worker]. Mesos Apache Mesos is an open-source technique for balancing resources across frameworks in clusters. \u21d2 See Apache Mesos Metadata Mantis inserts metadata into its [Job] payload. This may include information about where the data came from, for instance. You can define additional metadata to include in the payload when you establish the [Job Cluster]. meta message A [Source Job] may occasionally inject meta messages into its data stream that indicate things like data drops. migration strategy define Mantis Publish Mantis Publish (internally at Netflix known as Mantis Realtime Events or MRE) is a library that your application can use to stream events into Mantis while respecting [MQL] filters. \u21d2 See MQL . MQL You use Mantis Query Language to define filters and other data processing that Mantis applies to a [Source] data stream at its point of origin, so as to reduce the amount of data going over the wire. Observable In [ReactiveX] an Observable is the method of processing a stream of data in a way that facilitates its [transformation] and consumption by observers. Observables come in [hot] and [cold] varieties. There is also a GroupedObservable that is specialized to [grouped] data. \u21d2 See ReactiveX.io: Observable . Parameter A [Mantis Job] may accept parameters that modify its behavior. You can define these in your [Job Cluster] definition, and set their values on a per-Job basis. Processing Stage A Processing Stage component of a Mantis [Job] transforms the [RxJava] [Observables] it obtains from the [Source] component. A Job with only one Processing Stage is called a single-stage Job. \u21d2 See The Processing Stage Component property A property is a particular named data value found within events in an event stream. Reactive Streams Reactive Streams is the latest advance of the [ReactiveX] project. It is an API for manipulating streams of asynchronous data in a non-blocking fashion, with [backpressure]. \u21d2 See Reactive Streams . ReactiveX ReactiveX is a software technique for transforming, combining, reacting to, and managing streams of data. [RxJava] is an example of a library that implements this technique. \u21d2 See reactivex.io . RxJava RxJava is the Java implementation of [ReactiveX], a software technique for transforming, combining, reacting to, and managing streams of data. \u21d2 See reactivex.io . sampling Sampling is an MQL strategy for mitigating data volume issues. There are two sampling strategies: Random and Sticky. Random sampling uniformly downsamples the source stream to a percentage of its original volume. Sticky sampling selectively samples data from the source stream based on key values. \u21d2 See MQL: Sampling scalar data Scalar data is distinguished from keyed or [grouped] data in that it is not categorized into groups by key. Scalar data can be processed by an ordinary [ReactiveX] [Observable]. Sink The Sink is the final component of a Mantis [Job]. It takes the [Observables] that has been transformed by the [Processing Stage] and outputs it in the form of a new data stream. \u21d2 See The Sink Component SLA A service-level agreement , in the Mantis context, is defined on a per-[Cluster] basis. You use it to configure how many [Jobs] in the cluster will be in operation at any time, among other things. Source The Source component of a Mantis [Job] fetches data from a source outside of Mantis and makes it available to the [Processing Stage] component in the form of an [RxJava] [Observable]. There are two varieties of Source: a [Source Job] and a [custom source]. \u21d2 See The Source Component Source Job A Source Job is a Mantis [Job] that you can use as a [Source], which wraps a data source external to Mantis and makes it easier for you to create a job that observes its data. \u21d2 See Mantis Source Jobs server-sent events Server-sent events (SSE) are a way for a browser to receive automatic updates from a server through an HTTP connection. Mantis includes an SSE [Sink]. \u21d2 See Wikipedia: Server-sent events Transformation A transformation acts on each datum from a stream or [Observables] of data, changing it in some manner before passing it along as a new stream or Observable. Transformations may change data between [scalar] and [grouped] forms. transient jobs A transient (or ephemeral) [Mantis Job] is automatically killed by Mantis after a certain amount of time has passed since the last subscriber to the job disconnects. WebSocket WebSocket is a two-way, interactive communication channel that works over HTTP. In the Mantis context, it is an alternative to [SSE]. \u21d2 See WebSocket.org . Worker A worker is the smallest unit of work that is scheduled within a Mantis [component]. You can configure how many resources Mantis allocates to each worker, and Mantis will adjust the number of workers your Mantis component needs based on its [autoscaling] policy. Zookeeper Apache Zookeeper is an open-source server that maintains configuration information and other services required by distributed applications. \u21d2 See Apache ZooKeeper","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"develop/connectors/iceberg/","text":"Sink \u00b6 Add this package to your dependencies: implementation \"io.mantisrx:mantis-connector-iceberg:1.2.+\" The Iceberg Sink has two components: Writers and a Committer .

The Committer outputs a Map which you can subscribe to with a Sink for optional debugging or connecting to another Mantis Job. Otherwise, a Sink not required because the Committer will write directly to Iceberg. A Committer commits DataFile s to Iceberg. Records are queryable from the Iceberg table only after a Committer commits DataFile s. A Committer commits on a configured interval (default: 5 min). A Committer aligns to Mantis's at-most-once guarantee. This means if a commit fails, it will not retry that commit. It will instead continue and try to commit for the next window of Record s at the next interval. This avoids backpressure issues originating from downstream and is therefore more suitable to operational use cases. Important You should have only one Committer per Iceberg Table and try to avoid a high frequency commit intervals (default: 5 min ). This avoids commit pressure on Iceberg.

Records are queryable from the Iceberg table only after a Committer commits DataFile s. A Committer commits on a configured interval (default: 5 min). A Committer aligns to Mantis's at-most-once guarantee. This means if a commit fails, it will not retry that commit.

Mantis Publish takes care of filtering the events you send into Mantis, and it will only transmit them over the network if a downstream consumer that is interested in such events is currently subscribed. Mantis Publish contains a subscription registry where each client subscription is represented by its corresponding Mantis Query Language query. Mantis Publish evaluates all MQL queries from its subscription registry against each event as the event is generated by your application. It then tags events with all of the matching MQL queries and enriches the event with a superset of fields from the matched queries. That is, rather than emitting n events for n matching MQL queries, Mantis Publish will instead emit a single event containing all of the fields requested by the matched queries. This happens directly within your application before any events are sent over the network into Mantis. Further, Mantis Publish only dispatches events if a client is subscribed with a matching query. This means that you can freely produce events without incurring the cost until an active subscription exists. Choose a Package \u00b6 MRE works with both Guice-enabled and standalone injectors.

Until now we've run single stage Mantis jobs which a can run in a single process / container. Much of the power provided by Mantis is that we can design and implement a distributed job. Let's take a look at the groupby-sample job definition and then break it down stage by stage. @Override public Job < String > getJobInstance () { return MantisJob // Stream Request Events from our random data generator source . source ( new RandomRequestSource ()) // Groups requests by path . stage ( new GroupByStage (), GroupByStage . config ()) // Computes count per path over a window . stage ( new AggregationStage (), AggregationStage . config ()) // Collects the data and makes it availabe over SSE . stage ( new CollectStage (), CollectStage . config ()) // Reuse built in sink that eagerly subscribes and delivers data over SSE . sink ( Sinks . eagerSubscribe ( Sinks . sse (( String data ) -> data ))) . metadata ( new Metadata . Builder () . name ( \"GroupByPath\" ) . description ( \"Connects to a random data generator source\" + \" and counts the number of requests for each uri within a window\" ) . build ()) . create (); } The job definition above should look relatively familiar with the exception of the fact that our job has three stages. These stages and their configurations are all relatively simple but take advantage of the scalability of Mantis when used in conjunction with each other; The GroupByStage will group events according to some user specified criteria. The AggregationStage will perform an aggregation on a per-group basis. The CollectStage will collect all aggregations and create a report. Let's explore each of these stages in sequence. Stage 1: Group By Stage \u00b6 The GroupByStage implements ToGroupComputation<RequestEvent, String, RequestEvent> which tells Mantis that the call method will be returning MantisGroup<String, RequestEvent> which represents a group key and the data. You may recall in the previous tutorials we used the reactive groupBy operator to group data. The reactive operator performs an in-memory group by which has some scaling limitations. Grouping data using a Mantis stage does not have the same limitations and allows us to scale the group by operation across multiple containers. The config() method also changes to specify this different stage type. It also allows us to specify concurrentInput() on the config allowing the call method to be run concurrently in this container. Also note the result of getParameters() is added to the config via the withParameters method, it isn't an interface method for stages but we're specifying parameters this way for convenience. public class GroupByStage implements ToGroupComputation < RequestEvent , String , RequestEvent > { private static final String GROUPBY_FIELD_PARAM = \"groupByField\" ; private boolean groupByPath = true ; @Override public Observable < MantisGroup < String , RequestEvent >> call ( Context context , Observable < RequestEvent > requestEventO ) { return requestEventO . map (( requestEvent ) -> { if ( groupByPath ) { return new MantisGroup <> ( requestEvent . getRequestPath (), requestEvent ); } else { return new MantisGroup <> ( requestEvent . getIpAddress (), requestEvent ); } }); } @Override public void init ( Context context ) { String groupByField = ( String ) context . getParameters (). get ( GROUPBY_FIELD_PARAM , \"path\" ); groupByPath = groupByField . equalsIgnoreCase ( \"path\" ) ? true : false ; } /** * Here we declare stage specific parameters. * @return */ public static List < ParameterDefinition <?>> getParameters () { List < ParameterDefinition <?>> params = new ArrayList <> (); // Group by field params . add ( new StringParameter () . name ( GROUPBY_FIELD_PARAM ) . description ( \"The key to group events by\" ) . validator ( Validators . notNullOrEmpty ()) . defaultValue ( \"path\" ) . build ()) ; return params ; } public static ScalarToGroup . Config < RequestEvent , String , RequestEvent > config (){ return new ScalarToGroup . Config < RequestEvent , String , RequestEvent > () . description ( \"Group event data by path/ip\" ) . concurrentInput () // signifies events can be processed in parallel . withParameters ( getParameters ()) . codec ( RequestEvent . requestEventCodec ()); } } We should note that this stage is horizontally scalable. We can run as many of these as necessary to handle the inflow of data which is how Mantis allows us to run a scalable group by operation. Stage 2: Aggregation Stage \u00b6 The previous stage produces MantisGroup<String, RequestEvent> by implementing ToGroupComputation . If we think of ToGroupComputation producing groups of data we can think of GroupToScalarComputation<K, T, R> as the inverse computing a scalar value from a group. The init() , config() and getParameters() methods should be familiar by now but let's take a closer look at the call() method. We're performing the same operation the stream as we did in the first two tutorials. Notice how we still group by MantisGroup::getKeyValue . This is because while Mantis guarantees that all data for an individual group from the previous stage will land on the same container in this stage, it does not invoke the call() method for each individual group and thus we need to handle the groups ourselves. @Slf4j public class AggregationStage implements GroupToScalarComputation < String , RequestEvent , RequestAggregation { public static final String AGGREGATION_DURATION_MSEC_PARAM = \"AggregationDurationMsec\" ; int aggregationDurationMsec ; /** * The call method is invoked by the Mantis runtime while executing the job. * @param context Provides metadata information related to the current job. * @param mantisGroupO This is an Observable of {@link MantisGroup} events.

Config < String , RequestEvent , RequestAggregation > () . description ( \"sum events for a path\" ) . codec ( RequestAggregation . requestAggregationCodec ()) . withParameters ( getParameters ()); } /** * Here we declare stage specific parameters. * @return */ public static List < ParameterDefinition <?>> getParameters () { List < ParameterDefinition <?>> params = new ArrayList <> (); // Aggregation duration params . add ( new IntParameter () . name ( AGGREGATION_DURATION_MSEC_PARAM ) . description ( \"window size for aggregation\" ) . validator ( Validators . range ( 100 , 10000 )) . defaultValue ( 5000 ) . build ()) ; return params ; } } Much like the previous stage this stage is also horizontally scalable up to the cardinality of our group by. Allowing us to individually (or automatically via autoscaling) scale these two stages ensures this job can be correctly sized for the workload. Stage 3: Collect Stage \u00b6 The third stage collects data from all of the upstream workers and generates a report. We can see in the code below the stream is windowed for five seconds, then we flatmap a reduce over the window and invoke the RequestAggregationAccumulator#generateReport() method on the reduced value. @Slf4j public class CollectStage implements ScalarComputation < RequestAggregation , String > { private static final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper (); @Override public Observable < String > call ( Context context , Observable < RequestAggregation > requestAggregationO ) { return requestAggregationO . window ( 5 , TimeUnit .

Conclusion \u00b6 We've now explored the concept of a multi-stage Mantis job which allows us to horizontally scale individual stages and express group by and aggregate semantics as a Mantis topology.","title":"Writing Your Third Job"},{"location":"develop/writing-jobs/group-by/#writing-your-third-mantis-job-group-by-aggregate","text":"NOTE: This tutorial is a work in progress. Until now we've run single stage Mantis jobs which a can run in a single process / container. Much of the power provided by Mantis is that we can design and implement a distributed job.

These stages and their configurations are all relatively simple but take advantage of the scalability of Mantis when used in conjunction with each other; The GroupByStage will group events according to some user specified criteria. The AggregationStage will perform an aggregation on a per-group basis. The CollectStage will collect all aggregations and create a report. Let's explore each of these stages in sequence.","title":"Writing Your Third Mantis Job: Group By / Aggregate"},{"location":"develop/writing-jobs/group-by/#stage-1-group-by-stage","text":"The GroupByStage implements ToGroupComputation<RequestEvent, String, RequestEvent> which tells Mantis that the call method will be returning MantisGroup<String, RequestEvent> which represents a group key and the data. You may recall in the previous tutorials we used the reactive groupBy operator to group data. The reactive operator performs an in-memory group by which has some scaling limitations. Grouping data using a Mantis stage does not have the same limitations and allows us to scale the group by operation across multiple containers. The config() method also changes to specify this different stage type. It also allows us to specify concurrentInput() on the config allowing the call method to be run concurrently in this container. Also note the result of getParameters() is added to the config via the withParameters method, it isn't an interface method for stages but we're specifying parameters this way for convenience. public class GroupByStage implements ToGroupComputation < RequestEvent , String , RequestEvent > { private static final String GROUPBY_FIELD_PARAM = \"groupByField\" ; private boolean groupByPath = true ; @Override public Observable < MantisGroup < String , RequestEvent >> call ( Context context , Observable < RequestEvent > requestEventO ) { return requestEventO . map (( requestEvent ) -> { if ( groupByPath ) { return new MantisGroup <> ( requestEvent . getRequestPath (), requestEvent ); } else { return new MantisGroup <> ( requestEvent . getIpAddress (), requestEvent ); } }); } @Override public void init ( Context context ) { String groupByField = ( String ) context . getParameters (). get ( GROUPBY_FIELD_PARAM , \"path\" ); groupByPath = groupByField . equalsIgnoreCase ( \"path\" ) ? true : false ; } /** * Here we declare stage specific parameters. * @return */ public static List < ParameterDefinition <?>> getParameters () { List < ParameterDefinition <?>> params = new ArrayList <> (); // Group by field params . add ( new StringParameter () . name ( GROUPBY_FIELD_PARAM ) . description ( \"The key to group events by\" ) . validator ( Validators . notNullOrEmpty ()) . defaultValue ( \"path\" ) . build ()) ; return params ; } public static ScalarToGroup .

The Source \u00b6 We specify our source in the line .source(new IlliadSource()) . The source handles data ingestion and it is very common to use a pre-existing parameterized source when writing jobs. Mantis provides several sources which handle managing connections and queries to other jobs. In the next tutorial we'll learn how to implement our own source which ingests data from Twitter. The Stage \u00b6 Our stage implements the bulk of the processing logic for the streaming job. Recall that a Mantis job has 1..n stages which can be used to create a topology for data processing. This stage is a ScalarComputation but we'll learn about other stage types in the third tutorial when we make word counting a distributed job. We'll take advantage of Java's lambda syntax to implement this stage inline. The call method receives a Context object and an Observable<String> provided by our source. The stage's responsibility is to produce an Observable<R> for consumption by down stream stages or the sink if this is the last stage. . stage (( context , dataO ) -> dataO // Tokenize the string . flatMap (( text ) -> Observable . from ( tokenize ( text ))) // Hopping / Tumbling window of 10 seconds . window ( 10 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) // Reduce each window . flatMap (( wordCountPairObservable ) -> wordCountPairObservable // count how many times a word appears . groupBy ( WordCountPair :: getWord ) . flatMap (( groupO ) -> groupO . reduce ( 0 , ( cnt , wordCntPair ) -> cnt + 1 ) . map (( cnt ) -> new WordCountPair ( groupO . getKey (), cnt )))) // Convert the result to a string . map ( WordCountPair :: toString ) If you're familiar with reactive stream processing the above should be fairly easy to comprehend. Unfortunately if you aren't then an introduction to this is outside of the scope of this tutorial. Head over to reactivex.io to learn more about the concept. The stage configuration below specifies a few things; First that this stage is a scalar to scalar stage in that it ingests single events, and produces single events. The type of the input events is String, and the output is also String. Finally the configuration also specifies which Codec to use on the wire for this stage's output. You can use this configuration to specify concurrency for this stage as well, but we've not elected to do so here. public static ScalarToScalar . Config < String , String > scalarToScalarConfig () { return new ScalarToScalar . Config < String , String > () . codec ( Codecs . string ()); } The Job Provider \u00b6 The MantisJobProvider interface is what the Mantis runtime expects to load. The runtime reads resources/META-INF/services/io.mantisrx.runtime.MantisJobProvider to discover the fully qualified classname of the MantisJobProvider to be used as an entry point for the application. Main Method \u00b6 The main method invokes the LocalJobExecutorNetworked execute method to run our job locally. The first three tutorials will take advantage of the ability to run jobs locally. In the fourth tutorial we will explore uploading and submitting our job on a Mantis cloud deployment for greater scalability. We can and should run this main method by invoking ./gradlew :mantis-examples-wordcount:execute at the root of the mantis-examples directory. public static void main ( String [] args ) { LocalJobExecutorNetworked . execute ( new WordCountJob (). getJobInstance ()); } Conclusions and Future Work \u00b6 We've implemented a complete end-to-end Mantis job which counts words from The Illiad repeatedly. This leaves much to be desired. If you inspect our source we're really just iterating over the same data set every ten seconds. In the next tutorial we'll explore the task of writing our own custom source to pull external data from Twitter into Mantis and designing this source in a templated fashion so that it can be used with different queries and API keys. As an extra credit task see if you can modify the stage in this job to print the top 10 words instead of the entire list.","title":"Writing Your First Job"},{"location":"develop/writing-jobs/word-count/#writing-your-first-mantis-job","text":"We'll be doing the classic word count example for streaming data for the tutorial section.

It is a self contained platform that manages all tasks associated with running thousands of stream processing jobs. Take a look at Infrastructure Overview to get an understanding of the physical components of the Mantis Platform. Let us walk through some of the key concepts and terminologies used in Mantis. Mantis Job Cluster \u00b6 A Mantis Job cluster represents metadata (artifact, configuration, resource requirements) associated with a job. A job can be thought of as a running instance of Job Cluster (like a Java Object is an instance of a Java class). A Job cluster can have 0 or more running instances of a job at any given time. Users can control how many jobs can be running at any given time by specifying the SLA for this cluster. E.g. SLA of Min 1 / Max 1 means there is exactly one instance of job running at any given time. Users can also setup a Cron spec that can be used to submit jobs periodically. Mantis Jobs \u00b6 At the core of Mantis is the Mantis Job. Stream processing applications in Mantis are called Mantis Jobs. Logically a job represents the business logic to transform a stream of events from one or more sources and generate results. A developer writes a job using Mantis primitives and builds an artifact which is then deployed into the Mantis platform for execution. Each Mantis Job belongs to exactly one Mantis Job Cluster. Lets take a closer look at a Mantis Job. Worker \u00b6 A worker is the smallest unit of execution in Mantis. Physically a worker executes in a resource isolated Mesos container on the Mantis Agent fleet of servers. Each worker is assigned a unique monotonically increasing MantisWorkerIndex and a unique MantisWorkerNumber If a Mantis worker terminates abnormally, Mantis ensures a replacement worker gets launched with the same MantisWorkerIndex and a new MantisWorkerNumber . The resources like CPU, Memory, Network allocated to a worker are configured at Job submit time and cannot be updated later. Each Worker belongs to exactly one Mantis Stage. Stages (Group of workers) \u00b6 A Mantis job is logically divided into one or more stages . A stage is a collection of homogeneous Mantis Workers that perform the same computation. A typical map-reduce style job would be represented by three stages in Mantis (shuffle, window/aggregate and collect) Workers belonging to a stage establish network connections with all workers of the previous stage (if one exists) Workers of the same stage do not connect to each other. The presence of multiple stages imply network hops which allows users to distribute the job logic across several workers allowing for more scalability. Mantis allows each stage to dynamically scale the number of workers in the stage independently with the help of an autoscaling policy. Info Autoscaling is only recommended on stateless stages. For stateful stages the user would need to implement logic to move state to new workers. In cases where the state can be rebuilt rapidly this is not a concern. Mantis Runtime \u00b6 The Mantis runtime is execution environment for Mantis Jobs. Broadly speaking it covers all aspects of the running a Mantis Job which includes Operators based Reactive Extensions used by Jobs to implement their business logic. Job topology management which builds and maintains the job execution DAG Exchanging control messages with the Mantis Master including heartbeats among other things. Source Job \u00b6 A source job is a type of Mantis Job that makes data available to other Mantis Jobs via an MQL interface. Downstream jobs connect to the Sink (Server Sent Event) of the Source job with an MQL query which denotes what data the job is interested in. Each event flowing through the Source job is evaluated against these MQL queries. Events matching a particular query are then streamed to the corresponding downstream job. The source jobs have several advantages Pluggable source : By abstracting out where the data is coming from, the source jobs allow the downstream jobs to focus on just their processing logic. The same job can then work with data from different sources by simply connecting to a different source jobs. E.g There can be one source job (say A) backed by a Kafka topic and another backed by S3 (say B) and the downstream job can either connect to A or B based on whether they want to process realtime data or historical data. Data re-use : Often a lot of jobs are interested in data from the same source. Just that they maybe interested in different subsets of this data. Instead of each job having to re-fetch the same data again and again from the same external source, The source jobs fetch the data once and then make it available for any other job to use. Cost Efficiency : A direct consequence of data re-use is fewer resources are required. E.g Let us assume there are 3 jobs interested in processing data from the same Kafka topic. But each is interested in different subsets of this data. Traditionally, each job would have to read the topic in its entirety and then filter out the data they are not interested in. This means 3x fanout on Kafka, and additionally each job now has to have enough resources to process the entire topic. If this topic is high volume then these jobs would have to be sufficiently scaled to keep up. All while throwing away large portions of the data. With a source job the Kafka fan out is just 1 and the three downstream jobs need to be scaled just enough to process their anticipated subset of the stream. Less operational load : Source jobs are stateless and thus good candidates for Autoscaling. With autoscaling enabled the Mantis administrators do not have to worry about right sizing the resources, the job will just adapt its size to meet the demands. Mantis OSS comes with the following source jobs Kafka Source job : Reads data from one or more Kafka topics and makes it available for downstream consumers to query via MQL. Publish Source Job : Works the the mantis-publish library to fetch data on-demand from external applications and make it available to downstream consumers. See the On-Demand Sample to see this in action. Users can also build their own source jobs see the Synthetic Source Job example. Job Chaining \u00b6 One of the unique capabilities of Mantis is the ability for Jobs to communicate with each other to form a kind of streaming microservices architecture. The Source Job -> Downstream job flow is an example of this Job chaining. In this case the source of the downstream job is the output of the upstream Data source job. All a job needs to do to connect to the sink of another job is to include the in-built Job Connnector See the Job Connector Sample to see this in action. These job to job communications happen directly via in memory socket connections with no intermediate disk persistence. If buffering/persistence of results is desired then it is recommended to sink the data into persistence queue like Kafka using the Kafka Connector Job chaining has proven to be extremely useful while operating at scale. It is widely used in the Netflix deployment of Mantis. Mantis Query Language (MQL) \u00b6 MQL is a SQL like language that allows users to work with streaming data without having to write Java code. Example MQL query: select * from defaultStream where status == 500 MQL is used in various parts of Mantis platform including the mantis-publish library, Source Jobs and sometimes directly as a library within a Job that can benefit from the query and aggregation features it brings. Mantis Master \u00b6 The Mantis Master is a leader elected control plane for the Mantis platform. It is responsible for managing the life cycle of Job Clusters, Jobs and workers. It also acts as a Resource scheduler to optimally allocate and schedule resources required by the Jobs. The master stores its meta-data into an external source. The OSS version ships with a sample file based store. For production deployments a highly available store is recommended. The Master is built using Akka principles, where each Job Cluster, Job etc are modelled as Actors. For scheduling of resources Mantis relies on the Mesos Framework The Master registers itself as a Mesos Framework . It receives resource offers from Mesos and uses Fenzo to optimally match workers to these offers. Mantis API \u00b6 The Mantis API is almost like a traditional API server which proxies request to the Mantis Master. But has additional capabilities such as: Allowing users to stream the output of a job via web sockets ( /api/v1/jobConnectbyid/jobID API) Acts as a discovery server for Jobs, allowing consumers to get a stream of scheduling information (like host, port for workers belonging to a job)","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"getting-started/concepts/#mantis-concepts","text":"Mantis provides Stream-processing-As-a-Service.

Realtime monitoring of Netflix streaming health \u00b6 At Netflix Stream Starts per Second (SPS) is a key metric used to track the health of the Netflix streaming service. Streaming starts per second tracks the number of people successfully hitting play on their streaming devices. Any abnormal change in the trend of this metric signifies a negative impact on user's viewing experience. This Mantis application monitors the SPS trend by processing data sourced directly from thousands of Netflix servers (using the mantis-publish library) in realtime. Using a version of Double Exponential Smoothing (DES) it can detect abnormal deviations in seconds and alerts key teams at Netflix. Contextual Alerting \u00b6 As Netflix has grown over the years so has the number of microservices. Getting alerted for outages for your own service is often not sufficient to root-cause issues. Engineers need to understand what is happening with downstream and upstream services as well to be able to quickly narrow down the root of the issue. The Contextual alerting application analyzes millions of interactions between dozens of Netflix microservices in realtime to identify anomalies and provide operators with rich and relevant context. The realtime nature of these Mantis-backed aggregations allows the Mean-Time-To-Detect to be cut down from tens of minutes to a few seconds. Given the scale of Netflix this makes a huge impact. Raven \u00b6 In large distributed systems, often there are cases where a user reports a problem but the overall health of the system is green. In such cases there is a need to explore events associated with the user/device/service in realtime to find a smoking gun. With the potential of a user request landing across thousands of servers it is often a laborious task to find the right servers and inspect their logs. The Raven applications makes this task trivial, The raven jobs work with the mantis-publish library to look for events matching a certain criterion (user-id/device-id etc) right at the server and stream matching results in realtime. It provides an intuitive UI that allows SREs to construct and submit simple MQL queries. Cassandra and Elastic Search Health Monitoring \u00b6 Netflix maintains hundreds of Cassandra and Elastic Search clusters. These clusters are critical for the day to day operation of Netflix. The Cassandra and Elastic Search health application analyzes rich operational events sent by the Priam side car in realtime to generate a holistic picture of the health of every Cassandra cluster at Netflix. Since this system has gone into operation the number of false pages has dropped down significantly. Alerting on Log \u00b6 The Alerting on Logs application allows users to create alerts which page when a certain pattern is detected within the application logs. This application analyzes logs from thousands of servers in realtime. Chaos Experimentation monitoring \u00b6 Chaos Testing is one of the pillars of resilience at Netflix. Dozens of chaos experiments are run daily to test the resilience of variety of applications. The Chaos experimentation application tracks user experience by analyzing client and server side events during a Chaos exercise in realtime and triggers an abort of the chaos exercise in case of an adverse impact.

In this example we walk through publishing data to Mantis from a simple Java application using the mantis-publish library. Followed by setting up a Data Source Job that will act as a broker and a simple Mantis Job that when launched will trigger on-demand streaming of data matching a certain criterion. This end-to-end example highlights two powerful Mantis concepts On demand streaming of filtered data from external applications directly into Mantis Job Chaining where one Job connects to the output of another job. Prerequisites \u00b6 SharedMrePublishEventSource Job Cluster exists. JobConnectorSample Job cluster exists Java Sample is setup and running. Note If you are following the Mantis Cluster using Docker instructions all of this will be already set up. Publishing events into Mantis \u00b6 Note : The local docker setup has already preconfigured a simple Java Sample application to publish events to Mantis. Setting up a Publish Data Source Job \u00b6 A Publish Source Job is a special kind of a Mantis Job that interacts with the mantis-publish library on behalf of a downstream job to push subscriptions up to the mantis-publish library and receive events matching the subscription from the mantis-publish library. Submit the SharedMrePublishEventSource \u00b6 Part of the docker setup we have preconfigured the SharedMrePublishEventSource cluster. So all we have to do is submit an instance of it. Go to the clusters page and click on SharedMrePublishEventSource Click submit on the top right corner of the screen This will open up the Job Detail page. Now wait for the Job to go into Launched state You are all set. Now the Java application referenced in the previous section should be able to communicate with this source job to exchange subscriptions and data. At this point however there are no active subscriptions so no data is actually being sent out from our Java application. If you look at the shell window where the docker is running you should see output like mantispublish_1 | 2019 -10-16 17 :55:46 INFO SampleDataPublisher:56 - Mantis publish JavaApp send event status = > SKIPPED_NO_SUBSCRIPTIONS ( PRECONDITION_FAILED ) Next step. Launch a new job to query for Data generated by the Java application. Query data generated by the Java application. \u00b6 Our Java application generates a stream of Events representing requests made to it by an external client. Say we want to look at all events that are failing i.e have status=500 Submit a query job \u00b6 Now we launch a simple Mantis Job to query data generated by our Java Application. Go to clusters page and click on JobConnectorSample Click the green submit button on the top right corner of the screen. On the Job submit page scroll down and click on Override Defaults to configure our query. Enter the following as the value for parameter target json {\"targets\":[{\"sourceJobName\":\"SharedMrePublishEventSource\",\"criterion\":\"select * from defaultStream where status==500\"}]} and hit submit. Two key things to note: We set the sourceJobName to SharedMrePublishEventSource which is the source job we configured in the previous step.

Phase 1: Connecting \u00b6 Mantis Publish will only stream an event from your application into Mantis if there is a subscriber to that specific application instance with an MQL query that matches the event. Any [Mantis Job] can connect to these applications. However, it is a best practice to have [Source Jobs] connect to Mantis Publish applications. This is because Source Jobs provide several conveniences over regular Mantis Jobs, such as multiplexing events and connection management. By leveraging Source Jobs as an intermediary, Mantis Jobs are able to consume events from an external source without having to worry about lower-level details of that external source. This is possible through job chaining, which Mantis provides by default. When connecting to a Mantis Publish application, downstream Mantis Jobs will send subscription requests with an MQL query via HTTP to a Source Job. The Source Job will store these subscriptions in memory. These subscriptions are then fetched by upstream applications at the edge running the Mantis Publish library. Once the upstream edge Mantis Publish application is aware of the subscription, it will start pushing events downstream into the Source Job. Tip The Mantis Publish library not only handles subscriptions, but also takes care of discovering Source Job workers so you do not have to worry about Source Job rebalancing/autoscaling. For more information about Source Jobs see Mantis Source Jobs . Creating Stream Subscriptions \u00b6 Clients such as Mantis Jobs connect to a Mantis Publish application by submitting a subscription represented by an HTTP request. Mantis Publish\u2019s StreamManager maintains these subscriptions in-memory. The StreamManager manages internal resources such as subscriptions, streams, and internal processing queues. Clients can create subscriptions to different event streams. There are two types: default streams contain events emitted by applications that use the Mantis Publish library. log streams contain events which may not be core to the application, such as log or general infrastructure events. Phase 2: Event Processing \u00b6 Event processing within Mantis Publish takes place in two steps: event ingestion and event dispatch. Event Ingestion \u00b6 Event ingestion begins at the edge, in your application, by invoking EventPublisher#publish which places the event onto an internal queue for dispatching. Event Dispatch \u00b6 Events are dispatched by a drainer thread created by the Event Publisher. The drainer will drain events from the internal queue previously populated by EventPublisher#publish , perform some transformations, and finally dispatch events over the network and into Mantis. Events are transformed by an EventProcessor which processes events one at a time. Transformation includes the following steps: Masks sensitive fields in the event. Sensitive fields are referenced by a blacklist defined by a configuration. This blacklist is a comma-delimited string of keys you wish to blacklist in your event. Evaluates the MQL query of each subscription and builds a list of matching subscriptions. For each matching subscription, enriches the event with a superset of fields from the MQL query from all the other matching subscriptions (see the following diagram). Sends this enriched event to all of the subscribers (see Event Delivery below for the details). Info More Mantis Publish configuration options can be found in the mantis-publish configuration class . Phase 3: Event Delivery \u00b6 Mantis Publish delivers events on-demand.

Independent Mantis Jobs which receive streams of events as input, transform events one at a time, and produce streams of events as output. This page assumes familiarity with Mantis Job high-level concepts. An introduction can be found in Writing Mantis Jobs . This page presents internal details for Mantis Jobs. Mantis Job Components \u00b6 A Mantis Job consists of three components . Each one is based on a cold Observable that emits events to the next Observer in the Observable chain: Source The Source component is an RxFunction that consumes data in a streaming, non-blocking, backpressure -aware manner from an external service. Processing Stage A Processing Stage component is based on an RxFunction . This is where event transformations take place. There can be many Processing Stages in a Mantis Job. Sink The Sink component is based on an RxAction . It asynchronously emits results of the final Processing Stage to an external service. Note Mantis Jobs can consume events from typical external services such as APIs, databases, and Kafka topics. Mantis Jobs can also consume events emitted by other Mantis Jobs. This is referred to in Mantis as job chaining . Runtime Lifecycle \u00b6 The entry point for a Mantis Job is the Mantis Worker . The Mantis Master starts three primary services on a Mantis Worker when the Master boots the Worker up: The virtual machine worker service interacts with the underlying substrate, currently Mesos . This service subscribes to task updates and registers the Mantis Worker with Mesos executor callbacks to launch Mantis Jobs. The heartbeat service sends HTTP heartbeat requests to notify the Mantis Master that the worker is alive and available to process events. The stage executor dynamically loads bytecode for a Mantis Job, creates an in-memory representation of all the metadata required to execute events for that Mantis Job, and processes events for the current Processing Stage. Job Master Stage \u00b6 The Job Master autoscales Processing Stages. It can autoscale such stages independently of each other. If the configuration of a Job indicates that any Processing Stage is autoscalable, Mantis will automatically add a Job Master as the initial processing stage of the Job. This is a hidden stage that Job owners do not explicitly manage; instead, Mantis will create and configure a JobMasterService . This service creates a subscription to worker metrics via the WorkerMetricHandler and a MetricsClient which receives metrics over HTTP via SSE and sends them over to the JobAutoScaler . Job Autoscaler \u00b6 The Job autoscaler is based on a PID controller . Within this autoscaler are three controllers for CPU, memory, and network resources which continuously calculate an error value and apply corrections. Once the autoscaler makes a prediction, it delegates an API call to the Mantis Master to perform the scaling action on resources for a Processing stage. Single-Stage and Multi-Stage Jobs \u00b6 A Job with only one Processing Stage is a single-stage Job. In such a case, the entire Job (Source, Processing Stage, and Sink) will execute on the current worker node. A Job with more than one Processing Stage is a multi-stage Job. In such a Job, the stage executor will first inspect the current component. If the current component is a Source, then the executor will execute it as a Source. Otherwise, it will inspect the context again to determine if current component is a Sink. If so, it will acquire a port and create a SinkPublisher to publish events to the next Job.

There are four types of Source Jobs: Mantis Publish Source Jobs read from their sources by using the Mantis Publish client library. As such, they do not apply MQL on events themselves. Instead, they propagate the MQL queries upstream to Mantis Publish running on the external source, which then applies the MQL queries to the events it produces and only then pushes those events downstream to the Request Source Job. Kafka Source Jobs consume events from Kafka and apply MQL to each incoming event. Composition of a Source Job \u00b6 A Source Job is composed of three components: the default Source custom Processing Stages including a tagging operator the default Sink consisting of an SSE operator For example, here is how you might declare a Kafka Source Job: MantisJob . source ( KafkaSource ) . stage ( getAckableTaggingStage (), CustomizedAutoAckTaggingStage . config ()) . sink ( new TaggedDataSourceSink ( new QueryRequestPreProcessor (), new QueryRequestPostProcessor ())) . lifecycle (...) . create (); Source (RxFunction) \u00b6 The Source in this example contains code that creates and manages connections to Kafka using the 0.10 high level consumer. It creates an Observable with backpressure semantics by leveraging the SyncOnSubscribe class. Processing Stage (RxFunction) \u00b6 The next stage in this Job is the Processing Stage which enriches events with metadata . This stage transforms events in the following way: Applies a user-defined pre-mapping function. This is a Groovy function that takes a Map<String, Object> and returns a Map<String, Object> referenced by a variable named e . Filters out empty events. Inspects its internal subscription registry and enriches each event with all matching subscriptions. Subscriptions are represented by an MQL query and are registered when a consumer (e.g. Mantis Job) subscribes to the Source Job. Each event is enriched with fields specified by the projections of a subscription\u2019s MQL query, as in the following illustration: Sink (RxAction) \u00b6 In order for a consumer to consume events from a Source Job, the consumer connects to the Job\u2019s Sink. Consumers subscribe to a Source Job by sending a subscription request over HTTP to the Source Job\u2019s Sink. When a consumer connects to a Sink, the consumer must provide three query parameters: criterion \u2014 An MQL query string clientId \u2014 This is automatically generated if you use the Mantis client library; it defaults to the Mantis Job ID subscriptionId \u2014 This is used as a load-balancing mechanism for clientId A consumer (represented as a client through clientId ) may have many consumer instances (represented as susbcriptions through subscriptionId ). Source Jobs use clientId and subscriptionId to broadcast and/or load balance events to consumers. Source Jobs will broadcast an event to all clientId s. This means that consumer instances with different clientId s will each receive the same event. However, Source Jobs will load balance an event within a clientId . This means that consumer instances with the same clientId but different subscriptionId s are effectively grouped together. Events with the same clientId are load balanced among its subscriptionId s. Example of subscribing to a Source Job\u2019s Sink which outputs the results of a sine wave function: curl \"http:// instance-address : port ?clientId= myId &subscriptionId= mySubscription &criterion=select%20*%20where%20true\" data: {\"x\": 60.000000, \"y\": -3.048106} data: {\"x\": 100.000000, \"y\": -5.063656} data: {\"x\": 26.000000, \"y\": 7.625585} \u22ee Sinks have a pre-processor ( QueryRequestPreProcessor ), a post-processor ( QueryRequestPostProcessor ), and a router: The pre-processor is an RxFunction that registers the consumer\u2019s query, with their clientId and subscriptionId , into an in-memory cache called a QueryRefCountMap when a consumer instance connects to the Sink. This registers queries so that the Source Job can apply them to events as those events are ingested by the Source Job. The post-processor is an RxFunction that de-registers subscriptions from the QueryRefCountMap when a consumer instance disconnects from the Sink. The Source Job removes removes the clientId entirely from the QueryRefCountMap only when all of its subscriptionId s have been removed. The router routes incoming events for a clientId s to its subscriptions. It does this by using a drainer called a ChunkProcessor to drain events from an internal queue on an interval and randomly distribute the events to subscriptions. Note Typically, subscriptions to a Source Job come from other Mantis Jobs. However, because subscriptions are SSE endpoints, you can subscribe to Source Jobs over that same SSE endpoint to view the Job\u2019s output for debugging purposes. Caveats \u00b6 Source Jobs are single-stage Mantis Jobs that perform projection and filtering operations. MQL queries containing groupBy , orderBy , and window are ignored. These clauses are interpreted into RxJava operations and run by downstream Mantis Jobs. Mantis Publish-based Source Jobs do not autoscale .

RxJava Observables can be visualized by using \u201cmarble diagrams\u201d: You can combine multiple RxJava operators to transform an Observable stream of items in many ways: The above diagram shows a Mantis Job composed of two operators that process an input stream to compose an output stream. The first operator, map , emits a new Observable for each item emitted by the source Observable. The second operator, merge , emits each item emitted by those Observables as a fresh Observable stream. There is an enormous wealth of ways in which you can transform streams of data by using RxJava Observable operators. If the volume of data to be processed is too large for a single worker to handle, you can \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d by grouping and dividing the operators across various processing stages , as in the following diagram: Mantis Job Clusters \u00b6 You define a Job Cluster before you submit Jobs . A Job Cluster is a containing entity for Jobs. It defines metadata and certain service-level agreements ( SLA s). Job Clusters ease Job lifecycle management and Job revisioning. For example, by setting the SLA of a Job Cluster to Min=1 and Max=1, you ensure that exactly one Job instance is always running for that Cluster. The Job Cluster also has default Job parameters that any new Jobs submitted to the Cluster inherit. You can update new Job artifacts into the Job Cluster so that the next Job submission picks up the latest version. Components of a Mantis Job \u00b6 A Mantis Job has three components , each of which has a corresponding chapter in this documentation: Source \u2014 Fetches data from an external source and makes it available in the form of an Observable. Processing Stage \u2014 Transforms the Observable stream by means of a variety of operators. Sink \u2014 Pushes the resulting Observable out in the form of a fresh stream. Directory Structure of a Mantis Job \u00b6 In addition to the source files, Mantis requires some meta-files to be present in the Job artifact.

You can combine multiple Processing Stages into a single Job, or you can create a Job that consists of a single Processing Stage. In its simplest form, a Processing Stage is a chain of RxJava operators operating on the Observable provided by the Source component. Transformations can be broadly categorized into two types: Scalar or Grouped . There are four varieties of Processing Stage, based on what type of transformation they accomplish: Scalar-to-Scalar \u2014 Also known as \u201cnarrow transformation,\u201d this variety of Stage converts an Observable<T> into an Observable<R> . Such a Stage extends the ScalarToScalar class . Scalar-to-Key / Scalar-to-Group \u2014 Also known as \u201cwidening transformation,\u201d this variety of Stage groups each element emitted by the source Observable by key. Typically you use such a Stage when you build a map/reduce-style job in which you need to perform stateful computations but the volume of data is too large to fit on a single worker. In such a model, the incoming data is divided into multiple streams, one per group. A subsequent State will typically to the stateful computation (for instance, calculating percentiles for the group). The purpose of this Scalar-to-Key State is to tag each incoming element with the group that it belongs to. Mantis then takes care of routing all traffic for the same group to the same worker in the subsequent stage. Scalar-to-Key \u2014 This is the legacy way of grouping data (it is more elegant but comes with a performance penalty). You extend the ScalarToKey class and transform an Observable<T> into an Observable<GroupedObservable<K,R>> (where K is the key). See the RxJava groupBy operator for more information. Scalar-to-Group \u2014 This is a more efficient way to group data. You extend the ScalarToGroup class and transform an Observable<T> into an Observable<MantisGroup<K,R>> (where K is the key). This avoids the overhead associated with creating a GroupedObservable which can limit the number of groups it is possible to create. Key-to-Scalar / Group-to-Scalar \u2014 Once you have split a stream, you need a stage that can take grouped data and return it to a scalar form. Key-to-Scalar \u2014 This is the legacy method and is designed for streams that have been split via a ScalarToKey Stage. You extend the KeyToScalar class and transform a GroupedObservable<K,T> into an Observable<T> . Group-to-Scalar \u2014 This is the newer, faster method. It is less elegant, in that you must transform an Observable<MantisGroup> that contains payloads from all groups, and you must therefore manage the per-group state. Typically you would do this via a map that holds per-group state and evicts entries that haven\u2019t been touched recently. This method has much better performance than the Key-to-Scalar method because it omits the overhead around RxJava\u2019s GroupedObservable . Key-to-Key / Group-to-Group \u2014 You can further split a keyed stream by grouping it again if you have some use case that requires this.","title":"Processing Stage"},{"location":"internals/mantis-jobs/sink/","text":"The Sink component of a Mantis Job serves two purposes: Trigger job execution when a client subscribes to a Job RxJava cold Observables have a lazy execution model. Execution begins only when someone subscribes to the Observable. A Mantis Job is a complex Observable chain, and to trigger the execution of such a Job, somebody needs to subscribe to it. This happens in the Sink component. Output the results of job execution in a streaming fashion Once you are done processing the input stream in the Processing Stage component, you need to figure out what to do with the results. Most jobs that write to some other system do so within the Processing Stage component itself (in such a case, the Sink component is usually used for debugging purposes). To create a Sink component, you implement the Sink interface: import io.mantisrx.runtime.Context ; import io.mantisrx.runtime.PortRequest ; import rx.Observable ; import rx.functions.Action3 ; public interface Sink < T > extends Action3 < Context , PortRequest , Observable < T >> { } Built-in Sinks \u00b6 Some Sinks are provided by Mantis. To get access to these Sinks, add this line to your source: import io.mantisrx.runtime.sink.Sinks ; SSE Sink \u00b6 The SSE Sink is commonly used. It makes the results of your Stage transformation available in the form of an SSE stream. To get an SSE Sink, pass an encoder function to the sse() method that accepts the data to be streamed as input and outputs data encoded as needed. The following example attaches a sink to a Mantis Job that passes the data from the last Processing Stage of the job, unchanged, to the SSE stream: return MantisJob . \u2026 . sink ( Sinks . sse (( String data ) -> data )). \u2026 . create (); sysout Sink \u00b6 The sysout Sink simply outputs the results from the previous Processing Stage directly to sysout. For example: return MantisJob . \u2026 . sink ( Sinks . sysout ()). \u2026 . create (); eagerSubscribe Sink \u00b6 A typical Sink subscribes to the output of the previous Processing Stage at some point during the call to its call() method. You may want some of your Mantis Jobs to start executing as soon as you launch them. These include Jobs that run perpetually and power things like alerts, dashboards, and so forth. You can modify a Sink with eagerSubscribe() to create a Sink that that instead subscribes to the output of the previous Processing Stage immediately when its call() method is called, even if it has more processing to do within that method before it can respond to the output. This will start your Mantis Job more quickly, but may mean some of its initial data is dropped. For example: return MantisJob . \u2026 . sink ( Sinks . eagerSubscribe ( Sinks . sse (( String data ) -> data ))). \u2026 . create (); Here is a more complete example: return MantisJob // Reuse existing class that does all the plumbing of connecting to source jobs . source ( new JobSource ()) // Groups requests by ESN . stage ( new GroupByStage (), GroupByStage . config ()) // Computes sum over a window . stage ( new FastAggregateStage (), FastAggregateStage . config ()) // Collects the data and makes it availabe over SSE . stage ( new CollectStage (), CollectStage . config ()) // Reuse built in sink that eagerly subscribes and delivers data over SSE . sink ( Sinks . eagerSubscribe ( Sinks . sse (( String data ) -> data ) )) // Here we define the job parameter overrides // The query sent to the source job. // Here we fetch the esn for all requests hitting the source . parameterDefinition ( new StringParameter () . name ( MantisSourceJobConnector .

Builder () . name ( \"GroupByIp\" ) . description ( \"Connects to a source job and counts the number of requests sent from each ip within a window\" ) . build ()) . create (); toMany Sink \u00b6 You can hook up multiple Sinks to the same final Stage of a Job by using the toMany Sink. To do this, pass each Sink to the toMany() method. For example: return MantisJob . \u2026 . sink ( Sinks . toMany ( Sinks . sysout (), Sinks . sse (( String data ) -> data ))). \u2026 . create (); Custom Sinks \u00b6 If you do not want to use one of the provided Sinks, or if you need to customize one of those (for instance, if you need access to the query parameters supplied by a client who is connecting into your Job, or if you need pre and post hooks to perform operations as a new client connects or disconnects), you can create your own Sink.

A Source returns Observable<Observable<T>> , that is, an Observable that emits Observables. Each of the emitted Observables represents a stream of data from a single target server. Varieties of Sources \u00b6 Sources can be roughly divided into two categories: Sources that read data from the output of other Mantis Jobs this may include Source Jobs (more on this below) or ordinary Mantis Jobs Custom sources that read data directly from Amazon S3, SQS, Apache Kafka , etc. Mantis Job Sources \u00b6 You can string Mantis Jobs together by using the output of one Mantis Job as the input to another. This is useful if you want to break up your processing into multiple, reusable components and to take advantage of code and data reuse. In such a case, you do not have access to the complete set of Mantis Query Language (MQL) capabilities that you do in the case of a Source Job, but you can use MQL in client mode. Connecting to a Mantis Job \u00b6 To connect to a Mantis Job, use a JobSource when you call MantisJob.create() \u2014 declare the following parameters when you use this class: sourceJobName (required) \u2014 the name of any valid Job Cluster (not necessarily a \u201cSource Job\u201d) sample (optional) \u2014 use this if you want to sample the output sample times per second, or set this to -1 to disable sampling For example: MantisJob . source ( new JobSource ()) . stage ( \u2026 ) . sink ( \u2026 ) . parameterDefinition ( new StringParameter (). name ( \"sourceJobName\" ) . description ( \"The name of the job\" ) . validator ( Validators . notNullOrEmpty ()) . defaultValue ( \"MyDefaultJob\" ) . build ()) . parameterDefinition ( new IntParameter (). name ( \"sample\" ) . description ( \"The number of samples per second\" ) . validator ( Validators . range ( - 1 , 10000 )) . defaultValue ( - 1 ) . build ()) . lifecycle ( \u2026 ) . metadata ( \u2026 ) . create (); Source Job Sources \u00b6 Mantis has a concept of Source Jobs which are Mantis Jobs with added conveniences and efficiences that simplify accessing data from certain sources. Your job can simply connect to a source job as its data source rather than trying to retrieve the data from its native home. There are two advantages to this approach: Source Jobs handle all of the implementation details around interacting with the native data source. Source Jobs come with a simple query interface based on the Mantis Query Language (MQL) , which allows you to filter the data from the source before processing it. In the case of source jobs that fetch data from application servers directly, this filter gets pushed all the way to those target servers so that no data flows unless someone is asking for it. Source Jobs reuse data so that multiple matching MQL queries are forwarded downstream instead of paying the cost to fetch and serialize/deserialize the same data multiple times from the upstream source. Broadcast Mode \u00b6 By default, Mantis will distribute the data that is output from the Source Job among the various workers in the processing stage of your Mantis Job. Each of those workers will get a subset of the complete data from the Source Job. You can override this by instructing the Source Job to use \u201cbroadcast mode\u201d.

Both the agent cluster and the Mantis Jobs can be configured to autoscale. You can define a policy for your Jobs in which they autoscale their resources based on the dynamic needs resulting from variation in the input data they process. This provides two benefits: You can define Jobs to process data without provisioning for peak usage all the time. Mantis uses cluster resources optimally without leaving resources idle. Horizontal Scaling \u00b6 Your Mantis Jobs are composed of in part of Processing Stages , with each stage responsible for a different stream processing task. Because different stages may have different computational needs, each stage has its own autoscaling policy. A Processing Stage is further subdivided into workers . A worker is the smallest unit of work that is scheduled. Each worker requests a certain number of CPUs, some amount of memory, and a certain amount of network bandwidth. When a Processing Stage scales, the number of workers in that stage increases or decreases (the resources that Mantis allocates to an individual worker in the stage do not change as a result of scaling). Scaling a Processing Stage Manually \u00b6 You may define a Processing Stage as scalable without defining an autoscaling policy for it. In such a case the stage is considered manually scalable and you can scale it by means of the Mantis UI or the Mantis API . Setting an Autoscaling Policy \u00b6 Warning You should take care that your autoscaling strategies do not contradict each other. For example, if you set a CPU-based strategy and a network-based strategy, one may want to trigger a scale-up and the other a scale-down at the same time. You define the autoscaling policy for a Processing Stage by setting the following parameters: Min and Max number of workers \u2014 This sets how many workers Mantis will guarantee to be working within the Processing Stage at any particular time. Increment and decrement values \u2014 This indicates how many workers are added to or removed from a stage each time the stage autoscales up or down. Cooldown seconds \u2014 This indicates how many seconds to wait after a scaling operation has been completed before beginning another scaling operation. Stragtegies \u2014 An autoscaling policy has the following strategy parameters: Type \u2014 CPU, memory, network, or data drop Scale down below percentage \u2014 When the average value for all workers falls below this value, the stage will scale down. This value is calculated as actual usage divided by requested amounts (for data drop, as the number of data items dropped divided by the total number of data items, dropped+processed). Scale up above percentage \u2014 When the average value for all workers rises above this value, the stage will scale up. Rolling count \u2014 This value helps to keep jitter out of the autoscaling process. Instead of scaling immediately the first time values fall outside of the scale-down and scale-up percentage thresholds you define, Mantis will wait until the thresholds are exceeded a certain number of times within a certain window. For example, a rolling count of \u201c6 of 10\u201d means that only if in ten consecutive observations six or more of the observations fall below the scale-down threshold will the stage be scaled down. Note Ideally, there should be zero data drop, so there isn\u2019t an elegant way to express \u201cscale down below percentage\u201d for data drop. Specifying \u201c0%\u201d as the \u201cscale down below percentage\u201d effectively means the data drop percentage never trigger a scale down. For this reason, it is best to use the data drop strategy in conjunction with another strategy that provides the scale-down trigger. The following example shows how you might establish the autoscaling policy for a stage in the Mantis UI: The illustration above shows a stage with an autoscaling policy that specifies a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 20 workers. It uses a single strategy, that of network bandwidth usage. Autoscaling Scenarios \u00b6 There are four varieties of autoscaling scenarios that you should consider for your Mantis Job: The Processing Stage connects to a cold Source , such as a Kafka topic. Autoscaling works well for this type of stage (the initial stage in a Job that connects to the Source). For example, if your stage connects to a Kafka source, a change in the number of workers in the first stage of your Mantis Job causes the Kafka client to redistribute the partitions of the topic among the new number of workers. The Processing Stage connects to a hot source, such as a working server. The Source stage (stage #1) will have to re-partition the Source servers after an autoscale event on the Processing Stage. This is mainly a concern for Source Jobs . Upon receipt of a modified number of workers, each worker re-partitions the current servers into its own index of the new total. This results in a new list of servers to connect to (for both scale up and scale down), some of which may be already connected. Making a new connection to a Source server evicts any old existing connection from the same Job. This guarantees that no duplicate messages are sent to a Mantis Job. (The solution for this scenario is currently in development.) Rewrite this; it\u2019s not very clear. The Processing Stage connects to another Mantis Job. In this case, the initial Processing Stage in a Job that connects to the output of the previous Mantis Job has strong connectivity into the Source Job via the use of Mantis Java client. In suc a case, all workers from this Processing Stage connect to all workers of the source Job\u2019s Sink . Therefore, autoscaling this type of Job works well. The Processing Stage connects to a previous Processing Stage in the same Mantis Job. Each Processing Stage is strongly connected to its previous Processing Stage. Therefore, autoscaling of this type typically works well. However, a Processing Stage following a grouped stage (a Processing Stage that does a group by operation) receives a grouped Observable or MantisGroup . When Mantis scales such a grouped stage, these groups are repartitioned on to the new number of workers. The Processing Stage following such a grouped stage must, therefore, be prepared to potentially receive a different set of groups after a rescale operation. How does a subsequent stage learn that the previous stage has autoscaled? Note that the number of groups resulting from a group by operation is the maximum limit on the number of workers that can be expected to work on such groups (unless a subsequent processing stage subdivides those groups). In the following illustrations, a processing stage that does a group by operation groups the incoming data into three groups, each one of which is handled by a single worker in the subsequent processing stage. When that second stage scales up and adds another worker, that worker remains idle and does not assist in processing data because there are not enough groups to distribute among the larger number of workers. Before autoscaling: After autoscaling: Updating Autoscalable Jobs \u00b6 To upload a Mantis Job when you have new code to push, upload the .jar or .zip artifact file to Mantis, and make any necessary adjustments to its behavior and policies by using the Mantis UI. You can also do this in two ways via the Mantis API: Update the Job Cluster with a new version for its artifact file along with new scheduling information. This updated JAR and scheduling info are available to use with the next Job submission. However, currently-running Jobs continue to run with whatever artifact file they were started with. Quick update the Job Cluster with only a new artifact file version and submit a new Job with it. The new Job is submitted by using the scheduling info from the last Job submitted. The latter of the above two is convenient not only because you provide the minimal information needed to update the Job. But, also, because when it picks up the scheduling info from the last Job submitted, if it is running, the new Job is started with the same number of workers as the last one. That is, if it had scaled up, the new Job starts scaled up as well.","title":"Autoscaling"},{"location":"operate/autoscaling/#horizontal-scaling","text":"Your Mantis Jobs are composed of in part of Processing Stages , with each stage responsible for a different stream processing task.

Since stages are independent of one another, they are also sized independently. Stages have one or more workers , which are the fundamental unit of parallelism for a stage. Workers execute individual instances of a stage and are each allocated CPU, memory, disk, and network resources. Workers are also isolated from one another, which means they process events independently of each other using their own dedicated resources. You can horizontally scale your Mantis Jobs by modifying the number of workers of your stages. You can also vertically scale your Mantis Jobs by tuning the number of resources for each worker. The following sections are guidelines for sizing different types of Mantis Jobs. Note You can modify worker resources any time, even after you have already launched the Mantis Job. This is useful in cases where you might want to adjust your Mantis Job to new traffic patterns. You can do this by marking your stage as Stage is Scalable . You can also mark the stage as AutoScale this stage to have Mantis automatically scale the stage. You can horizontally scale your Mantis Jobs without restarting the entire job. However, vertically scaling your jobs requires a new job submission for changes to take effect. Mantis Jobs \u00b6 In addition to scaling the number of workers of a Mantis Job, you should consider tuning your workers, which have two tunable properties: processing resources and processing parallelism. For processing resources , you should generally determine if CPU , memory , or network resources will be a bottleneck in your processing. You should increase: the number of CPUs if your job has CPU-intensive transformations such as serialization and deserialization memory if your job plans to hold many objects or large objects in memory network resources if your job needs high throughput for network I/O such as external API calls For processing parallelism , you must choose between serial or concurrent input processing for each stage. Serial input processing means your Processing Stage will receive and process events within a single thread. With serial input, you lose parallelism but your processing logic becomes straightforward without race conditions. // Specifying serial input for a stage. public class SerialStage implements ScalarComputation < T1 , T2 > { static public ScalarToScalar . Config < T1 , T2 > config () { return new ScalarToScalar . Config < T1 , T2 > (). serialInput (); } } Concurrent input means your Processing Stage will have multiple threads which each receive and process events. With concurrent input enabled, race conditions must be considered because the stage\u2019s threads operate independently from one another and may process events at different speeds. // Specifying concurrent input for a stage. public class SerialStage implements ScalarComputation < T1 , T2 > { static public ScalarToScalar . Config < T1 , T2 > config () { return new ScalarToScalar . Config < T1 , T2 > (). concurrentInput (); } } Note Workers use serial input by default. Kafka Source Jobs \u00b6 Kafka Source Jobs are Mantis Jobs that share the same properties described above, except Kafka Source Jobs use concurrent input processing by default. There are additional job parameters to consider when tuning Kafka Source Jobs: numConsumerInstances and stageConcurrency . The numConsumerInstances property determines how many Kafka consumers will be created for each worker. For example, if you have numConsumerInstances set to 2 and have 5 workers, then you will have 10 Kafka consumers in total for your Mantis Job consuming from a Kafka topic. The stageConcurrency property determines a pool of threads which receive events by the Kafka consumers. You can control your processing parallelism with this property. For example, if you have numConsumerInstances set to 2 and stageConcurrency set to 5 on a worker, then two Kafka consumers will read events from a Kafka topic and asynchronously send them to a pool of 5 processing threads. There are three considerations for using numConsumerInstances and stageConcurrency to tune your Kafka Source Job. First, you can pin numConsumerInstances to 1 and add more workers to load balance Kafka consumers across worker instances. If you find that your workers are under-utilized, you can increase numConsumerInstances for each worker. You can also give each worker more CPU, memory, and network resources and increase numConsumerInstances further so that you have fewer workers doing more work. Lastly, if you find that your Kafka topic\u2019s lag is increasing, then processing might be a bottleneck. In this case, you can increase stageConcurrency to increase processing throughput. Note Adding more workers to scale your Kafka Source Jobs to increase throughput or address lag has a hard upper limit. Ensure that you do not have more Kafka consumers than the number of partitions of the Kafka topic that your job is reading from. Specifically, ensure that: (numConsumerInstances \u00d7 numberOfWorkers) \u2264 numberOfPartitions (numConsumerInstances \u00d7 numberOfWorkers) \u2264 numberOfPartitions This is because the number of partitions is a Kafka topic\u2019s upper bound for parallelism.

Specifically, ensure that: (numConsumerInstances \u00d7 numberOfWorkers) \u2264 numberOfPartitions (numConsumerInstances \u00d7 numberOfWorkers) \u2264 numberOfPartitions This is because the number of partitions is a Kafka topic\u2019s upper bound for parallelism. If you exceed this number, then you will have idle consumers wasting resources which means adding more workers to your Kafka Source Job will not have any positive effect.","title":"Kafka Source Jobs"},{"location":"reference/api/","text":"In addition to the Mantis UI, there is a REST API with which you can maintain Mantis Jobs and Job Clusters . This page describes the open source version of the Mantis REST API. You can use the Mantis REST API to submit Jobs based on existing Job Cluster or to connect to the output of running Jobs. It is easier to set up or update new Job Clusters by using the Mantis UI, but you can also do this with the Mantis REST API. Response Content Type Mantis API endpoints always return JSON, and do not respect content-type headers in API requests.

Query Parameters Query Parameter Purpose ascending (optional) You can use this to indicate whether or not to sort the records in ascending order ( true fields (optional) By default this endpoint will return all of the fields in the payload. You can set fields to a comma-delimited series of payload fields, in which case this endpoint will return only those fields of the payload. For example ?fields=name . offset (optional) The record number to begin with in the set of records to return in this request (use this with pageSize to get records by the page). See Pagination for more details. pageSize (optional) The maximum number of records to return in this request (default = 0, which means all records). See Pagination for more details. sortBy (optional) You can set this to the name of any payload field whose values are Comparable and this endpoint will return its results sorted by that field. matching (optional) You can set this to a regular expression, and Mantis will filter the list of Job Clusters on the server side, and will return only those that match this expression.

A Job Cluster contains a unique name for the Job, a URL of the Job\u2019s .jar or .zip artifact file, resource requirements to run your Job, and other optional information such as SLA values for minimum and maximum Jobs to keep active for this Cluster, or a cron-based schedule to launch a Job for this Cluster. Each new Job can be considered as an instance of the Job Cluster, and is given a unique ID by appending a number suffix to the Cluster name. The Job inherits the resource requirements from the Cluster unless whoever submits the Job overrides these at submit time. A Job Cluster name must match this regular expression: ^[A-Za-z]+[A-Za-z0-9+-_=:;]* To create a new Job Cluster, issue a POST command to the Mantis REST API endpoint /api/v1/jobClusters with a request body that matches format of the following example: Example Request Body { \"jobDefinition\": { \"name\": \"jschmoe_validation\", \"user\": \"jschmoe\", \"jobJarFileLocation\": \"https://some.host/mantis-artifacts/mantis-examples-sine-function-0.2.9.zip\", \"version\": \"0.2.9 2019-03-19 17:01:36\", \"schedulingInfo\": { \"stages\": { \"1\": { \"numberOfInstances\": \"1\", \"machineDefinition\": { \"cpuCores\": \"1\", \"memoryMB\": \"1024\", \"diskMB\": \"1024\", \"networkMbps\": \"128\", \"numPorts\": \"1\" }, \"scalable\": false, \"softConstraints\": [], \"hardConstraints\": [] } } }, \"parameters\": [], \"labels\": [ { \"name\": \"_mantis.user\", \"value\": \"jschmoe\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.ownerEmail\", \"value\": \"jschmoe@netflix.com\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.artifact\", \"value\": \"mantis-examples-sine-function\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.artifact.version\", \"value\": \"0.2.9\" } ], \"migrationConfig\": { \"strategy\": \"PERCENTAGE\", \"configString\": \"{\\\"percentToMove\\\":25,\\\"intervalMs\\\":60000}\" }, \"slaMin\": \"0\", \"slaMax\": \"0\", \"cronSpec\": null, \"cronPolicy\": \"KEEP_EXISTING\" }, \"owner\": { \"contactEmail\": \"jschmoe@netflix.com\", \"description\": \"\", \"name\": \"Joe Schmoe\", \"repo\": \"\", \"teamName\": \"\" } } Example Response Format { \"name\": \"jschmoe_validation1\", \"jars\": [ { \"url\": \"https://mantis.us-east-1.prod.netflix.net/mantis-artifacts/mantis-examples-sine-function-0.2.9.zip\", \"uploadedAt\": 1553040262171, \"version\": \"0.2.9 2019-03-19 17:01:36\", \"schedulingInfo\": { \"stages\": { \"1\": { \"numberOfInstances\": 1, \"machineDefinition\": { \"cpuCores\": 1, \"memoryMB\": 1024, \"networkMbps\": 128, \"diskMB\": 1024, \"numPorts\": 1 }, \"hardConstraints\": [], \"softConstraints\": [], \"scalingPolicy\": null, \"scalable\": false } } } } ], \"sla\": { \"min\": 0, \"max\": 0, \"cronSpec\": null, \"cronPolicy\": null }, \"parameters\": [], \"owner\": { \"name\": \"Joe Schmoe\", \"teamName\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"contactEmail\": \"jschmoe@netflix.com\", \"repo\": \"\" }, \"lastJobCount\": 0, \"disabled\": false, \"isReadyForJobMaster\": false, \"migrationConfig\": { \"strategy\": \"PERCENTAGE\", \"configString\": \"{\\\"percentToMove\\\":25,\\\"intervalMs\\\":60000}\" }, \"labels\": [ { \"name\": \"_mantis.user\", \"value\": \"jschmoe\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.ownerEmail\", \"value\": \"jschmoe@netflix.com\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.artifact\", \"value\": \"mantis-examples-sine-function\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.artifact.version\", \"value\": \"0.2.9\" } ], \"cronActive\": false, \"latestVersion\": \"0.2.9 2019-03-19 17:01:36\" } Possible Response Codes Response Code Reason 201 normal response 405 incorrect HTTP verb (use POST instead) 409 cluster name already exists 500 unknown server error Setting Jobs to Launch at Particular Times \u00b6 You can use the cronSpec field in the body of this request to specify when to launch the Jobs in the Cluster. By default this is blank ( \"\" ). If you set cronSpec to a non-blank value, this also sets the min and max values for the Job Cluster to 0 and 1 respectively. That is to say, you can have no more than one Job running at any one time for that Cluster. Optionally, you can provide a policy ( cronpolicy ) to use when a cron trigger fires while a previosuly submitted Job for the Job Cluster is still running. The possible policy values are KEEP_EXISTING (do not replace the current Job) and KEEP_NEW (replace the current Job with a new one). The default policy is KEEP_EXISTING . Note If the Mantis Master is down during a time window when cron would normally have fired, that cron trigger time window is lost. Mantis does not check for this upon restart. The next cron trigger will resume normally.

Increment the version number so as to differentiate your new Cluster from the previous Job artifacts . If you try to update an existing Job Cluster by reusing the version number of an existing one, the operation will fail.

This lets you update the Job Cluster with minimal information, without having to specify the scheduling info, as long as at least one Job was previously submitted for this Job Cluster. Mantis copies the scheduling information, Job parameters , and so forth, from the last Job submitted. To do this, send a POST command to the Mantis REST API endpoint /api/v1/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/updateArtifact with a body that matches the format of the following example: Example Request Body { \"name\": \"ValidatorDemo\", \"version\": \"0.0.1 2019-02-06 11:30:49\", \"url\": \"mantis-artifacts/demo-0.0.1-dev201901231434.zip\", \"skipsubmit\": false, \"user\": \"jschmoe\" } Example Response Format sine-function Job cluster updated Possible Response Codes Response Code Reason 204 normal response 404 no cluster with the given cluster name was found 405 incorrect HTTP verb (use POST instead) 500 unknown server error You will receive in the response the Job ID of the newly submitted Job (unless you set skipsubmit to true in the request body, in which case no such Job will be created). Update a Cluster\u2019s SLA \u00b6 /api/v1/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/updateSla ( POST ) To update the SLA of a Job Cluster without having to submit a new version, send a POST command to the Mantis REST API endpoint /api/v1/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/updateSla with a body that matches the format of the following example: Example Request Body { \"user\": \"YourUserName\", \"name\": \"Foo\", \"min\": 0, \"max\": 2, \"cronspec\": \"5 * * * * ?\", \"cronpolicy\": \"KEEP_EXISTING\", \"forceenable\": true } The fields of this body are as follows: SLA Field Purpose user (required) name of the user calling this endpoint name (required) name of the Job Cluster min minimum number of Jobs to keep running max maximum number of Jobs to allow running simultaneously cronspec cron specification, see below for format and examples cronpolicy either KEEP_EXISTING or KEEP_NEW (see above for details) forceenable either true or false ; reenable the Job Cluster if it is in the disabled state Note While min , max , cronspec , cronpolicy , and forceenable are all optional fields, you should provide at minimum either cronspec or the combination of min & max . The cron specification string is defined by Quartz CronTrigger . Here are some examples: Examples of cronspec Values example cronspec value resulting job trigger time \"0 0 12 * * ?\" Fire at 12 p.m. (noon) every day. \"0 15 10 ? * *\" Fire at 10:15 a.m. every day. \"0 15 10 * * ?\" Fire at 10:15 a.m. every day. \"0 0-5 14 * * ?\" Fire every minute starting at 2 p.m. and ending at 2:05 p.m., every day. Scheduling information for Jobs launched by means of cron triggers is inherited from the scheduling information for the Job Cluster. Warning If a Job takes required parameters , the Job will not launch successfully if the Job Cluster does not establish defaults for those parameters. A Job launched by means of a cron trigger always uses these default parameters to launch the Job. If you provide an invalid cron specification, this will disable the Job Cluster. To fix this, when you reformulate your cron specification, also set forceenable to \"true\" in the body that you send via POST to /api/v2/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/updateSla .

To do this, send a POST command to the Mantis REST API endpoint /api/v1/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/updateLabel with a body that matches the format of the following example: Example Request Body { \"name\": \"SPaaSBackpressureDemp\", \"labels\": [ { \"name\": \"_mantis.user\", \"value\": \"jschmoe\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.ownerEmail\", \"value\": \"jschmoe@netflix.com\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.artifact\", \"value\": \"backpressure-demo-aggregator-0.0.1\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.artifact.version\", \"value\": \"dev201901231434\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.jobType\", \"value\": \"aggregator\" }, { \"name\": \"_mantis.criticality\", \"value\": \"medium\" }, { \"name\": \"myTestLabel\", \"value\": \"bingo\" } ], \"user\": \"jschmoe\" } Example Response Format sine-function labels updated Possible Response Codes Response Code Reason 204 normal response 404 no cluster with the given cluster name was found 405 incorrect HTTP verb (use POST instead) 500 unknown server error Enable a Cluster \u00b6 /api/v1/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/enableCluster ( POST ) You can quickly change the state of an existing Job Cluster to enabled=true without having to update the entirety of the Cluster definition. To do this, send a POST command to the Mantis REST API endpoint /api/v1/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/enableCluster with a body that matches the format of the following example: Example Request Body { \"name\": \"SPaaSBackpressureDemp\", \"user\": \"jschmoe\" } Example Response Format sine-function enabled Possible Response Codes Response Code Reason 204 normal response 404 no cluster with the given cluster name was found 405 incorrect HTTP verb (use POST instead) 500 unknown server error Disable a Cluster \u00b6 /api/v1/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/disableCluster ( POST ) You can quickly change the state of an existing Job Cluster to enabled=false without having to update the entirety of the Cluster definition. When you disable a Job Cluster Mantis will not allow new Job submissions under that Cluster and it will terminate any Jobs from that Cluster that are currently running. Mantis will also stop enforcing the SLA requirements for the Cluster, including any cron setup that would otherwise launch new Jobs. This is useful when a Job Cluster must be temporarily made inactive, for instance if you have determined that there is a problem with it. To do this, send a POST command to the Mantis REST API endpoint /api/v1/jobClusters/ clusterName /actions/disableCluster with a body that matches the format of the following example: Example Request Body { \"name\": \"SPaaSBackpressureDemp\", \"user\": \"jschmoe\" } Example Response Format sine-function disabled Possible Response Codes Response Code Reason 204 normal response 404 no cluster with the given cluster name was found 405 incorrect HTTP verb (use POST instead) 500 unknown server error Get a Map of Mantis Publish Push-Based Streams to Clusters \u00b6 /api/v1/mantis/publish/streamJobClusterMap ( GET ) describe Example Response Format { \"version\": \"1\", \"timestamp\": 2, \"mappings\": { \"__default__\": { \"requestEventStream\": \"SharedMantisPublishEventSource\", \"__default__\": \"SharedMantisPublishEventSource\" } } } Possible Response Codes Response Code Reason 200 normal response 405 incorrect HTTP verb (use GET instead) 500 unknown server error Job Tasks \u00b6 TBD Get a List of Jobs \u00b6 /api/v1/jobs ( GET ) To retrieve a JSON array of IDs of the active Jobs , issue a GET command to the Mantis REST API endpoint /api/v1/jobs . Query Parameters Query Parameter Purpose ascending (optional) You can use this to indicate whether or not to sort the records in ascending order ( true compact (optional) Ask the server to return compact responses ( true fields (optional) By default this endpoint will return all of the fields in the payload. You can set fields to a comma-delimited series of payload fields, in which case this endpoint will return only those fields in the response. limit (optional) The maximum record size to return (default = no limit). offset (optional) The record number to begin with in the set of records to return in this request (use this with pageSize to get records by the page). See Pagination for more details. pageSize (optional) The maximum number of records to return in this request (default = 0, which means all records). See Pagination for more details. sortBy (optional) You can set this to the name of any payload field whose values are Comparable and this endpoint will return its results sorted by that field. There is also a series of query parameters that you can use to set server-side filters that will restrict the jobs represented in the resulting list of jobs to only those jobs that match the filters: Query Parameter What It Filters activeOnly (optional) The activeOnly field (boolean). By default, this is true . jobState (optional) Job state, Active or Terminal . By default, this endpoint filters on jobState=Active . This query parameter has precedence over the activeOnly parameter. labels (optional) Labels in the labels array. You can express this by setting this parameter to a comma-delimited list of label strings. labels.op (optional) Use this parameter to tell the server whether to treat the list of labels you have provided as an or (default: a job that contains any of the labels will be returned in the list), or an and (only jobs that contain all of the labels will be returned).

An endpoint that supports pagination will typically do so by means of two query parameters: Query Parameter Purpose pageSize the maximum number of records to return in this request (default = 0, which means all records) offset the record number to begin with in the set of records to return in this request So, for example, you might make consecutive requests for\u2026 endpoint ?pageSize=10&offset=0 endpoint ?pageSize=10&offset=10 endpoint ?pageSize=10&offset=20 \u2026and so forth, until you reach the final page of records. When you request records in a paginated fashion like this, the Mantis API will enclose them in a JSON structure like the following: { \"list\": [ { \"Id\": originalOffset , \u22ee }, { \"Id\": originalOffset+1 , \u22ee }, \u22ee ], \"prev\": \"/api/v1/ endpoint ?pageSize= pageSize &offset= originalOffset+pageSize \", \"next\": \"/api/v1/ endpoint ?pageSize= pageSize &offset= originalOffset\u2212pageSize \" } For example: { \"list\" : [ { \"Id\" : 101 , \u22ee }, { \"Id\" : 102 , \u22ee } ], \"next\" : \"/api/v1/someResource?pageSize=20&offset=120\" , \"prev\" : \"/api/v1/someResource?pageSize=20&offset=80\" } prev and/or next will be null if there is no previous or next page, that is, if you are at the first and/or last page in the pagination. WebSocket \u00b6 Some desktops have trouble dealing with SSE . In such a case you can use WebSocket to connect to a Job (other API features are only available via the Mantis REST API). The WebSocket API runs from the same servers as the Mantis REST API, and you can reach it by using the ws:// protocol on port 7102 or the wss:// protocol on port 7103. Connecting to Job Output (Sink) \u00b6 Append this to the WebSocket URI to connect to a Job by name: /jobconnectbyname/ JobName Append this to the WebSocket URI to connect to a specific running Job ID: /jobconnectbyid/ JobID Upon connecting, the server starts writing messages that are coming in from the corresponding Jobs. You can append query parameters to the WebSocket URI (preceded by \u201c ? \u201d) as is the case in a REST API. Use this to pass any Sink parameters your Job accepts. All Jobs accept the \u201c sampleMSec= mSecs \u201d Sink parameter which limits the rate at which the Sink output is sampled by the server. Submitting and Connecting to Job Output \u00b6 Append this to the WebSocket URI to submit and connect to the submitted Job: /jobsubmitandconnect Note that you will have to send one message on the WebSocket, which is the same JSON payload that you would send as a POST body for the equivalent REST API . The server then submits the Job and then starts writing messages into the WebSocket as it gets output from the Job. You can append query parameters to the WebSocket URI (preceded by \u201c ? \u201d) as is the case in a REST API. Use this to pass any Sink parameters your Job accepts. All Jobs accept the \u201c sampleMSec= mSecs \u201d sink parameter which limits the rate at which the Sink output is sampled by the server.

Refer to the RxJava 1.x Operator Guide for more details.","title":"Job DSL"},{"location":"reference/mql/","text":"This page introduces the MQL operators, including a syntax summary, usage examples, and a brief description of each operator. For the most part these operations use their RxJava analogs: MQL operator RxJava operator select map window window where filter group by groupBy order by n/a limit take For this reason you may find the ReactiveX documentation useful as well, though it is a goal of MQL to provide you with a layer of abstraction such that you will not need to use or think about ReactiveX when writing queries. MQL attempts to stay true to the SQL syntax in order to reduce friction for new users writing queries and to allow them to leverage their experiences with SQL. An essential concept in MQL is the \u201c property ,\u201d which can take on one of several forms: property.name.here e[\"this\"][\"accesses\"][\"nested\"][\"properties\"] 15 \"string literal\" Most of the MQL operators use these forms to refer to properties within the event stream, as well as string and numeric literals. The last detail of note concerns unbounded vs. discrete streams. ReactiveX Observables that are not expected to close are an unbounded stream and must be bounded/discretized in order for certain operators to function with them. The window operator is useful for partitioning unbounded streams into discrete bounded streams for operators such as aggregate, group by, or order by. select \u00b6 Syntax: select property from source Examples: \"select * from servo\" \"select nf.node from servo\" \"select e[\"tags\"][\"nf.cluster\"] from servo\" The select operator allows you to project data into a new object by specifying which properties should be carried forward into the output. Properties will bear the same name as was used to select them. In the case of numbers and string literals their value will also be their name. In the case of nested properties the result will be a top-level object joined with dots. For example, the following select example\u2026 \"select \"string literal\", 45, e[\"tags\"][\"cluster\"], nf.node from servo\" \u2026would result in an object like: { \"string literal\" : \"string literal\" , 45: 45, \"tags.cluster\" : \"mantisagent\" , \"nf.node\" : \"i-123456\" } Warning Be careful to avoid collisions between the top-level objects with dotted names and the nested objects that result in top-level properties with dotted names. Aggregates \u00b6 Syntax: \"select aggregate ( property ) from source \" Examples: \"select count(e[\"node\"]) from servo window 60\" \"select count(e[\"node\"]) from servo window 60 where e[\"metrics\"][\"latency\"] > 350\" \"select average(e[\"metrics\"][\"latency\"]), e[\"node\"] from servo window 10\" Supported Aggregates: Min Max Average Count Sum Aggregates add analysis capabilities to MQL in order to allow you to answer interesting questions about data in real-time. They can be intermixed with regular properties in order to select properties and compute information about those properties, such as the last example above which computes average latency on a per-node basis in 10 second windows. Note Aggregates require that the stream on which they operate be discretized. You can ensure this either by feeding MQL a cold Observable in its context or by using the window operator on an unbounded stream. You can use the distinct operator on a property to operate only on unique items within the window. This is particularly useful with the count aggregate if you want to count the number of items with some distinct property value in that window. For example: \"select count(distinct esn) from stream window 10 1\" from \u00b6 Syntax: \"select something from source \" Example: \"select * from servo\" The from clause indicates to MQL from which Observable it should draw data. This requires some explanation, as it bears different meaning in different contexts. Directly against queryable sources the from clause refers to the source Observable no matter which name is given. The operator is in fact optional, and the name of the source is arbitrary in this context, and the clause will be inserted for you if you omit it. When you use MQL as a library, the source corresponds with the names in the context map parameter. The second parameter to eval-mql() is a Map<String, Observable<T>> and the from clause will attempt to fetch the Observable from this Map . window \u00b6 Syntax: \"WINDOW integer \" Examples: \"select node, latency from servo window 10\" \"select MAX(latency) from servo window 60\" The window clause divides an otherwise unbounded stream of data into discrete time-bounded streams. The integer parameter is the number of seconds over which to perform this bounding. For example \"select * from observable window 10\" will produce 10-second windows of data. This discretization of streams is important for use with aggregate operations as well as group-by and order-by clauses which cannot be executed on, and will hang on, unbounded streams. where \u00b6 Syntax: \"select property from source where predicate \" Examples: \"select * from servo where node == \"i-123456\" AND e[\"metrics\"][\"latency\"] > 350\" \"select * from servo where (node == \"i-123456\" AND e[\"metrics\"][\"latency\"] > 350) OR node == \"1-abcdef\"\" \"select * from servo where node ==~ /i-123/\" \"select * from servo where e[\"metrics\"][\"latency\"] != null \"select * from servo where e[\"list_of_requests\"][*][\"status\"] == \"success\" The where clause filters any events out of the stream which do not match a given predictate. Predicates support AND and OR operations. Binary operators supported are = , == , <> , != , < , <= , > , >= , ==~ . The first two above are both equality, and either of the next two represent not-equal. You can use the last of those operators, ==~ , with a regular expression as in: \"where property ==~ / regex /\" (any Java regular expression will suffice). To take an event with certain attribute, use e[\"{{key}}\"] != null . If the event contains a list field, you can use the [*] operator to match objects inside that list. For example, say the events have a field called list_of_requests and each item in the list has a field called status . Then, the condition e[\"list_of_requests\"][*][\"status\"] == \"success\" will return true if at least 1 item has status equals success . Further, you can combine multiple conditions on the list. For example, e[\"list_of_requests\"][*][\"status\"] == \"success\" AND e[\"list_of_requests\"][*][\"url\"] == \"abc\" This condition returns true if at least 1 item has status equals success and url equals abc . group by \u00b6 Syntax: \"GROUP BY property \" Examples: \"select node, latency from servo where latency > 300.0 group by node\" \"select MAX(latency), e[\"node\"] from servo group by node\" group by groups values in the output according to some property. This is particularly useful in conjunction with aggregate operators in which one can compute aggregate values over a group. For example, the following query calculates the maximum latency observed for each node in 60-second windows: \"select MAX(latency), e[\"node\"] from servo window 60 group by node\" Note The group by clause requires that the stream on which it operates be discretized. You can ensure this either by feeding MQL a cold Observable in its context or by using the window operator on an unbounded stream. order by \u00b6 Syntax: \"ORDER BY property \" Example: \"select node, latency from servo group by node order by latency\" The order by operator orders the results in the inner-most Observable by the specified property. For example, the query \"select * from observable window 5 group by nf.node order by latency\" would produce an Observable of Observables (windows) of Observables (groups). The events within the groups would be ordered by their latency property. Note The order by clause requires that the stream on which it operates be discretized. You can ensure this either by feeding MQL a cold Observable in its context or by using the window operator on an unbounded stream. limit \u00b6 Syntax: \"LIMIT integer \" Examples: \"select * from servo limit 10\" \"select AVERAGE(latency) from servo window 60 limit 10\" The limit operator takes as a parameter a single integer and bounds the number of results to \u2264 integer . Note Limit does not discretize the stream for earlier operators such as group by , order by , aggregates.","title":"MQL"},{"location":"reference/mql/#select","text":"Syntax: select property from source Examples: \"select * from servo\" \"select nf.node from servo\" \"select e[\"tags\"][\"nf.cluster\"] from servo\" The select operator allows you to project data into a new object by specifying which properties should be carried forward into the output.

For example: \"select count(distinct esn) from stream window 10 1\"","title":"Aggregates"},{"location":"reference/mql/#from","text":"Syntax: \"select something from source \" Example: \"select * from servo\" The from clause indicates to MQL from which Observable it should draw data. This requires some explanation, as it bears different meaning in different contexts. Directly against queryable sources the from clause refers to the source Observable no matter which name is given. The operator is in fact optional, and the name of the source is arbitrary in this context, and the clause will be inserted for you if you omit it. When you use MQL as a library, the source corresponds with the names in the context map parameter. The second parameter to eval-mql() is a Map<String, Observable<T>> and the from clause will attempt to fetch the Observable from this Map .","title":"from"},{"location":"reference/mql/#window","text":"Syntax: \"WINDOW integer \" Examples: \"select node, latency from servo window 10\" \"select MAX(latency) from servo window 60\" The window clause divides an otherwise unbounded stream of data into discrete time-bounded streams. The integer parameter is the number of seconds over which to perform this bounding. For example \"select * from observable window 10\" will produce 10-second windows of data. This discretization of streams is important for use with aggregate operations as well as group-by and order-by clauses which cannot be executed on, and will hang on, unbounded streams.","title":"window"},{"location":"reference/mql/#where","text":"Syntax: \"select property from source where predicate \" Examples: \"select * from servo where node == \"i-123456\" AND e[\"metrics\"][\"latency\"] > 350\" \"select * from servo where (node == \"i-123456\" AND e[\"metrics\"][\"latency\"] > 350) OR node == \"1-abcdef\"\" \"select * from servo where node ==~ /i-123/\" \"select * from servo where e[\"metrics\"][\"latency\"] != null \"select * from servo where e[\"list_of_requests\"][*][\"status\"] == \"success\" The where clause filters any events out of the stream which do not match a given predictate. Predicates support AND and OR operations. Binary operators supported are = , == , <> , != , < , <= , > , >= , ==~ . The first two above are both equality, and either of the next two represent not-equal. You can use the last of those operators, ==~ , with a regular expression as in: \"where property ==~ / regex /\" (any Java regular expression will suffice). To take an event with certain attribute, use e[\"{{key}}\"] != null . If the event contains a list field, you can use the [*] operator to match objects inside that list. For example, say the events have a field called list_of_requests and each item in the list has a field called status . Then, the condition e[\"list_of_requests\"][*][\"status\"] == \"success\" will return true if at least 1 item has status equals success . Further, you can combine multiple conditions on the list. For example, e[\"list_of_requests\"][*][\"status\"] == \"success\" AND e[\"list_of_requests\"][*][\"url\"] == \"abc\" This condition returns true if at least 1 item has status equals success and url equals abc .","title":"where"},{"location":"reference/mql/#group-by","text":"Syntax: \"GROUP BY property \" Examples: \"select node, latency from servo where latency > 300.0 group by node\" \"select MAX(latency), e[\"node\"] from servo group by node\" group by groups values in the output according to some property. This is particularly useful in conjunction with aggregate operators in which one can compute aggregate values over a group. For example, the following query calculates the maximum latency observed for each node in 60-second windows: \"select MAX(latency), e[\"node\"] from servo window 60 group by node\" Note The group by clause requires that the stream on which it operates be discretized.

The events within the groups would be ordered by their latency property. Note The order by clause requires that the stream on which it operates be discretized.
