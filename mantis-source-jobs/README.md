## Development

### Building

```sh
$ ./gradlew clean build
```

### Testing

```sh
$ ./gradlew clean test
```

### Building deployment into local Maven cache

```sh
$ ./gradlew clean publishNebulaPublicationToMavenLocal
```

### Releasing

We release by tagging which kicks off a CI build. The CI build will run tests, integration tests,
static analysis, checkstyle, build, and then publish to the public Bintray repo to be synced into Maven Central.

Tag format:

```
vMajor.Minor.Patch
```

You can tag via git or through Github's Release UI.
